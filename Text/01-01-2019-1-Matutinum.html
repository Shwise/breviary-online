<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">J</i>esus, the Ransomer of man, <br />
Who, ere created light began, <br />
Didst from the sovereign Father spring,<br />
His power and glory equalling.<br />
 <br />
The Father’s Light and Splendor Thou,<br />
Their endless hope to Thee that bow;<br />
Accept the prayers and praise to-day<br />
That through the world Thy servants pay.<br />
 <br />
Salvation’s Author, call to mind<br />
How, taking form of humankind,<br />
Born of a Virgin undefiled,<br />
Thou in man’s flesh becam’st a Child.<br />
 <br />
Thus testifies the present day, <br />
Through every year in long array, <br />
That Thou, salvation’s source alone,<br />
Proceedest from the Father’s throne.<br />
 <br />
The heavens above, the rolling main<br />
And all that earth’s wide realms contain,<br />
With joyous voice now loudly sing<br />
The glory of their new-born King.<br />
 <br />
And we who, by Thy precious Blood<br />
From sin redeemed, are marked for God,<br />
On this the day that saw Thy birth,<br />
Sing the new song of ransomed earth.<br />
 <br />
O Lord, the Virgin-born, to Thee<br />
Eternal praise and glory be, <br />
Whom with the Father we adore <br />
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath said unto Me: Thou art My Son, * this day have I begotten thee.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 2</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">2:1</span>  Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?<br />
<span class="w">2:2</span>  The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, * against the Lord and against his Christ.<br />
<span class="w">2:3</span>  Let us break their bonds asunder: * and let us cast away their yoke from us.<br />
<span class="w">2:4</span>  He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: * and the Lord shall deride them.<br />
<span class="w">2:5</span>  Then shall he speak to them in his anger, * and trouble them in his rage.<br />
<span class="w">2:6</span>  But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain, * preaching his commandment.<br />
<span class="w">2:7</span>  The Lord hath said to me: * Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.<br />
<span class="w">2:8</span>  Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, * and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.<br />
<span class="w">2:9</span>  Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, * and shalt break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.<br />
<span class="w">2:10</span>  And now, O ye kings, understand: * receive instruction, you that judge the earth.<br />
<span class="w">2:11</span>  Serve ye the Lord with fear: * and rejoice unto him with trembling.<br />
<span class="w">2:12</span>  Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, * and you perish from the just way.<br />
<span class="w">2:13</span>  When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, * blessed are all they that trust in him.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 18</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">18:2</span>  The heavens shew forth the glory of God, * and the firmament declareth the work of his hands.<br />

<span class="w">18:4</span>  There are no speeches nor languages, * where their voices are not heard.<br />

<span class="w">18:6</span>  He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: * and he, as a bridegroom coming out of his bride chamber,<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,<br />
<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">18:9</span>  The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">18:10</span>  The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.<br />
<span class="w">18:11</span>  More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br />
<span class="w">18:12</span>  For thy servant keepeth them, * and in keeping them there is a great reward.<br />
<span class="w">18:13</span>  Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: * and from those of others spare thy servant.<br />
<span class="w">18:14</span>  If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />

Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans<br />
<span class="ri">Rom 4:1-8</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> As David also termeth the blessedness of a man, to whom God reputeth justice without works:<br />
<span class="w">7</span> Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him Which taketh away the sins of the world; behold Him of Whom I said unto you: He That cometh after me is preferred before me<br />
* Whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> He that is of the earth speaketh of the earth; He That cometh from heaven is above all.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Son, the Sole-begotten, mercifully bless and keep us. Amen. <br />
 <br />
<b>Reading 2</b><br />
<span class="ri">Rom 4:9-12</span><br />
<span class="w">9</span> This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only, or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith, which he had, being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised, that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:<br />
<span class="w">12</span> And might be the father of circumcision; not to them only, that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faithful, that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> This day which is breaking is holy; O come, ye Gentiles, and worship the Lord.<br />
* For this day is much light come down unto us from heaven.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us rejoice and be glad in it.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For this day is much light come down unto us from heaven.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
<span class="ri">Rom 4:13-17</span><br />
<span class="w">13</span> For not through the law was the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice of faith.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, the promise is made of no effect.<br />
<span class="w">15</span> For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,<br />
<span class="w">17</span> As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations, before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead; and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Blessed be He That cometh in the name of the Lord! God is the Lord Who hath showed us light.<br />

Dearly beloved brethren, whosoever will keep truly and honour piously this day's festival, it is necessary for him neither to think falsely of the Lord's Incarnation, nor meanly of the Lord's Godhead. For as there is danger, on the one hand, of denying the truth of Christ's participation of our nature, so is there no less danger, on the other, of doing despite to the equality of His glory with the glory of the Father. Wherefore, when we draw near to understand the mystery of Christ's Birth, wherein He was born of the Virgin Mary, we must leave the clouds of earthly imagination behind and pierce the fog of human wisdom with the eye of enlightened faith.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Rejoice with me, all ye that love the Lord.<br />
* For while I was yet little I pleased the Most High, and from my womb have I brought forth God and man.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> All generations shall call me blessed, for God hath regarded the lowliness of His hand-maiden.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For while I was yet little I pleased the Most High, and from my womb have I brought forth God and man.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May Christ to all His people give, for ever in His sight to live. Amen.<br />

The authority on which we believe is the authority of God Himself; the teaching which we follow is the teaching of God Himself. Wherefore whether we lend the ear of our mind to the testimony of the Law, or to the revelations of the Prophets, or to the full pealing of the Gospel trumpet, that is true, which John the Son of Thunder, uttered, when he was filled with the Holy Ghost, and said: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The Same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made. True also is his witness when he saith: The Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father. <span class="w">John i. 1-3, 14.</span><br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The heart of the Virgin was fixed, when the Angel declared unto her the mystery of God, and she conceived, then did she receive in her pure womb Him That is fairer than the children of men.<br />
* And, she that is blessed for ever, brought forth for us God and man.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Soon rises, in that modest shrine, The Temple of the Lord Divine The stainless and unwedded one, Within her womb conceived the Son.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And, she that is blessed for ever, brought forth for us God and man.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Spirit's fire Divine in our hearts enkindled shine. Amen. <br />

The Person of the Son of God therefore remaineth unchanged and one, though He have two natures, keeping His own, and taking ours. He appeareth as man to be the restorer of men, but abideth all the while in His immutable Godhead. That Godhead which He shareth with the Father was not a whit the less Almighty, nor did the form of a servant touch the form of God to derogate from it. The Most High and Everlasting Being, bending down for man's salvation, took the Manhood into His glory; He ceased not to be That which He is from everlasting. Hence we see the Only-begotten Son of God in one place confessing that the Father is greater than He, <span class="w">John xiv. 28,</span> and in another declaring that He and the Father are One, <span class="w">x. 30.</span> This is an evident proof of the distinction of His two natures, and the unity of His Person; for He is inferior to the Father as touching His Manhood, and yet equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and yet, though He be God and Man, He is not two, but One Christ.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Blessed and worshipful art thou, O Virgin Mary; from thee, still maiden undefiled, the Saviour came a little Child.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke<br />
<span class="ri">Luke 2:21</span><br />
In that time, after eight days were accomplished, that the child should be circumcised, his name was called Jesus. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Ambrose, Bishop <span class="w">of Milan.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Book ii on Luke ii</span><br />
So the Child is circumcised. This is the Child of Whom it is said: Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, <span class="w">Isa. ix. 6.</span> Made under the law to redeem them that were under the law. <span class="w">Gal. iv. 4.</span> To present Him to the Lord, <span class="w">22.</span> In my Commentary on Isaiah I have already explained what is meant by being presented to the Lord in Jerusalem, and therefore I will not enter into the subject again. He that is circumcised in heart gaineth the protection of God, for the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous. <span class="w">Ps. xxxiii. 16.</span> Ye will see that as all the ceremonies of the old law were types of realities in the new, so the circumcision of the body signified the cleansing of the heart from the guilt of sin.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O Mary, how holy and how spotless is thy virginity! I am too dull to praise thee!<br />
* For thou hast borne in thy breast Him Whom the heavens cannot contain.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For thou hast borne in thy breast Him Whom the heavens cannot contain.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />
 <br />
<b>Reading 8</b><br />
But since the body and mind of man remain yet infected with a proneness' to sin, the circumcision of the eighth day is also a type of that complete cleansing from sin which we shall have at the resurrection. This ceremony was also performed in obedience to the commandment of God: Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy unto the Lord. These words were written with especial reference to the delivery of the Blessed Virgin. Truly He That opened her womb was holy, for He was altogether without spot, and we may gather that the law was written specially for Him from the words of the Angel: That Holy Thing Which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Virgin-Mother that knew not a man, bore, but travailed not.<br />
* She fed the Saviour of the world, The King of Angel hosts above, Jesus, our Redeemer blest, From the fountain of her breast.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Soon rises in that modest shrine, The Temple of the Lord Divine; The stainless and unwedded one, Within her womb conceived the Son.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> She fed the Saviour of the world, The King of Angel hosts above, Jesus, our Redeemer blest, From the fountain of her breast.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> She fed the Saviour of the world, The King of Angel hosts above, Jesus, our Redeemer blest, From the fountain of her breast.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />
 <br />
<b>Reading 9</b><br />
Among all that are born of women the Lord Jesus Christ stood alone in holiness. Fresh from His immaculate Birth, He felt no contagion from human corruption, and His heavenly Majesty drove it away. If we are to follow the letter and say that every male that openeth the womb is holy, how shall we explain that so many have been unrighteous? Was Ahab holy? Were the false prophets holy? Were they holy on whom Elijah justly called down fire from heaven? But He to Whom the sacred commandment of the law of God is mystically directed is the Holy One of Israel; Who also alone hath opened the secret womb of His holy Virgin-bride the Church, filling her with a sinless fruitfulness to give birth to Christian souls.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
