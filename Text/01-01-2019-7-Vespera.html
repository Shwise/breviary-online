<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esus, the Ransomer of man, <br />
Who, ere created light began, <br />
Didst from the sovereign Father spring,<br />
His power and glory equalling.<br />
 <br />
The Father’s Light and Splendor Thou,<br />
Their endless hope to Thee that bow;<br />
Accept the prayers and praise to-day<br />
That through the world Thy servants pay.<br />
 <br />
Salvation’s Author, call to mind<br />
How, taking form of humankind,<br />
Born of a Virgin undefiled,<br />
Thou in man’s flesh becam’st a Child.<br />
 <br />
Thus testifies the present day, <br />
Through every year in long array, <br />
That Thou, salvation’s source alone,<br />
Proceedest from the Father’s throne.<br />
 <br />
The heavens above, the rolling main<br />
And all that earth’s wide realms contain,<br />
With joyous voice now loudly sing<br />
The glory of their new-born King.<br />
 <br />
And we who, by Thy precious Blood<br />
From sin redeemed, are marked for God,<br />
On this the day that saw Thy birth,<br />
Sing the new song of ransomed earth.<br />
 <br />
O Lord, the Virgin-born, to Thee<br />
Eternal praise and glory be, <br />
Whom with the Father we adore <br />
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />
