<br />
<span class="ri">Isa 60:1</span><br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">W</i>hy, impious Herod, vainly fear<br />
That Christ the Saviour cometh here?<br />
He takes no earthly realms away<br />
Who gives the crown that lasts for aye.<br />
 <br />
To greet His birth the Wise Men went,<br />
Led by the star before them sent;<br />
Called on by light, towards light they pressed,<br />
And by their gifts their God confessed.<br />
 <br />
In holy Jordan's purest wave<br />
The heavenly Lamb vouchsafed to lave;<br />
That He, to whom was sin unknown,<br />
Might cleanse His people from their own.<br />
 <br />
New miracle of power divine!<br />
The water reddens into wine:<br />
He spake the word: and poured the wave<br />
In other streams than nature gave.<br />
 <br />
All glory, Lord, to thee we pay<br />
For thine Epiphany to-day:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To Father and to Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The kings of Arabia and Saba shall offer gifts.<br />
