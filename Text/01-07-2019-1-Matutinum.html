<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">W</i>hy, impious Herod, vainly fear<br />
That Christ the Saviour cometh here?<br />
He takes no earthly realms away<br />
Who gives the crown that lasts for aye.<br />
 <br />
To greet His birth the Wise Men went,<br />
Led by the star before them sent;<br />
Called on by light, towards light they pressed,<br />
And by their gifts their God confessed.<br />
 <br />
In holy Jordan's purest wave<br />
The heavenly Lamb vouchsafed to lave;<br />
That He, to whom was sin unknown,<br />
Might cleanse His people from their own.<br />
 <br />
New miracle of power divine!<br />
The water reddens into wine:<br />
He spake the word: and poured the wave<br />
In other streams than nature gave.<br />
 <br />
All glory, Lord, to thee we pay<br />
For thine Epiphany to-day:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To Father and to Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven * upon the children of men.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 13</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  The fool hath said in his heart: * there is no God.<br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: * there is none that doth good, no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:2</span>  The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see if there be any that understand and seek God.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: * there is none that doth good: no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: * the poison of asps is under their lips.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; * their feet are swift to shed blood.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Destruction and unhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: * there is no fear of God before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">13:4</span>  Shall not all they know that work iniquity, * who devour my people as they eat bread?<br />
<span class="w">13:5</span>  They have not called upon the Lord: * there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.<br />
<span class="w">13:6</span>  For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man; * but the Lord is his hope.<br />
<span class="w">13:7</span>  Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? * when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> He who worketh justice * may rest on thy holy mountain, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 14</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">14:1</span>  Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest in thy holy hill?<br />
<span class="w">14:2</span>  He that walketh without blemish, * and worketh justice:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  He that speaketh truth in his heart, * who hath not used deceit in his tongue:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: * nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.<br />
<span class="w">14:4</span>  In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: * but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not; * He that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that doth these things, * shall not be moved for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> He who worketh justice may rest on thy holy mountain, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, incline * thy ear to me, and hear my voice, my Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 16</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">16:1</span>  Hear, O Lord, my justice: * attend to my supplication.<br />
<span class="w">16:1</span>  Give ear unto my prayer, * which proceedeth not from deceitful lips.<br />
<span class="w">16:2</span>  Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: * let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable.<br />
<span class="w">16:3</span>  Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, * thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.<br />
<span class="w">16:4</span>  That my mouth may not speak the works of men: * for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.<br />
<span class="w">16:5</span>  Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: * that my footsteps be not moved.<br />
<span class="w">16:6</span>  I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: * O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.<br />
<span class="w">16:7</span>  Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; * thou who savest them that trust in thee.<br />
<span class="w">16:8</span>  From them that resist thy right hand keep me, * as the apple of thy eye.<br />
<span class="w">16:9</span>  Protect me under the shadow of thy wings. * from the face of the wicked who have afflicted me.<br />
<span class="w">16:10</span>  My enemies have surrounded my soul: They have shut up their fat: * their mouth hath spoken proudly.<br />
<span class="w">16:11</span>  They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: * they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.<br />
<span class="w">16:12</span>  They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; * and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.<br />
<span class="w">16:13</span>  Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; * deliver my soul from the wicked one; thy sword from the enemies of thy hand.<br />
<span class="w">16:14</span>  O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: * their belly is filled from thy hidden stores.<br />
<span class="w">16:14</span>  They are full of children: * and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.<br />
<span class="w">16:15</span>  But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: * I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, incline thy ear to me, and hear my voice, my Lord.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 17(2-16)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">17:2</span>  I will love thee, O Lord, my strength: * The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer.<br />
<span class="w">17:3</span>  My God is my helper, * and in him will I put my trust.<br />
<span class="w">17:3</span>  My protector, and the horn of my salvation, * and my support.<br />
<span class="w">17:4</span>  Praising, I will call upon the Lord: * and I shall be saved from my enemies.<br />
<span class="w">17:5</span>  The sorrows of death surrounded me: * and the torrents of iniquity troubled me.<br />
<span class="w">17:6</span>  The sorrows of hell encompassed me: * and the snares of death prevented me.<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  In my affliction I called upon the Lord, * and I cried to my God:<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  And he heard my voice from his holy temple: * and my cry before him came into his ears.<br />
<span class="w">17:8</span>  The earth shook and trembled: * the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them.<br />
<span class="w">17:9</span>  There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his face: * coals were kindled by it.<br />
<span class="w">17:10</span>  He bowed the heavens, and came down, * and darkness was under his feet.<br />
<span class="w">17:11</span>  And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; * he flew upon the wings of the winds.<br />
<span class="w">17:12</span>  And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him: * dark waters in the clouds of the air.<br />
<span class="w">17:13</span>  At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, * hail and coals of fire.<br />
<span class="w">17:14</span>  And the Lord thundered from heaven, * and the Highest gave his voice: * hail and coals of fire.<br />
<span class="w">17:15</span>  And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: * he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  Then the fountains of waters appeared, * and the foundations of the world were discovered:<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  At thy rebuke, O Lord, * at the blast of the spirit of thy wrath.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord will reward me * according to my justice.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 17(17-35)</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">17:17</span>  He sent from on high, and took me: * and received me out of many waters.<br />
<span class="w">17:18</span>  He delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them that hated me: * for they were too strong for me.<br />
<span class="w">17:19</span>  They prevented me in the day of my affliction: * and the Lord became my protector.<br />
<span class="w">17:20</span>  And he brought me forth into a large place: * he saved me, because he was well pleased with me.<br />
<span class="w">17:21</span>  And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; * and will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:<br />
<span class="w">17:22</span>  Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; * and have not done wickedly against my God.<br />
<span class="w">17:23</span>  For all his judgments are in my sight: * and his justices I have not put away from me.<br />
<span class="w">17:24</span>  And I shall be spotless with him: * and shall keep myself from my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">17:25</span>  And the Lord will reward me according to my justice: * and according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.<br />
<span class="w">17:26</span>  With the holy thou wilt be holy; * and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent:<br />
<span class="w">17:27</span>  And with the elect thou wilt be elect: * and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted.<br />
<span class="w">17:28</span>  For thou wilt save the humble people; * but wilt bring down the eyes of the proud.<br />
<span class="w">17:29</span>  For thou lightest my lamp, O Lord: * O my God, enlighten my darkness.<br />
<span class="w">17:30</span>  For by thee I shall be delivered from temptation; * and through my God I shall go over a wall.<br />
<span class="w">17:31</span>  As for my God, his way is undefiled: the words of the Lord are fire-tried: * he is the protector of all that trust in him.<br />

<span class="w">17:33</span>  God, who hath girt me with strength; * and made my way blameless.<br />

Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans<br />
<span class="ri">Rom 9:1-5</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost:<br />
<span class="w">2</span> That I have great sadness, and continual sorrow in my heart.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh,<br />
<span class="w">4</span> Who are Israelites, to whom belongeth the adoption as of children, and the glory, and the testament, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises:<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> There are three precious gifts which the wise men offered unto the Lord on this day, and they speak a mystery of the things of God:<br />
* Gold, to show His kingly power; frankincense, for our Great High Priest; and myrrh, against the Lord's burying.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The wise men worshipped the Captain of our Salvation, as He lay in the manger, and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him mystic gifts.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Gold, to show His kingly power; frankincense, for our Great High Priest; and myrrh, against the Lord's burying.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Son, the Sole-begotten, mercifully bless and keep us. Amen. <br />

<span class="ri">Rom 9:6-10</span><br />
<span class="w">6</span> Not as though the word of God hath miscarried. For all are not Israelites that are of Israel:<br />
<span class="w">7</span> Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called:<br />
<span class="w">8</span> That is to say, not they that are the children of the flesh, are the children of God; but they, that are the children of the promise, are accounted for the seed.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> For this is the word of promise: According to this time will I come; and Sara shall have a son.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> And not only she. But when Rebecca also had conceived at once, of Isaac our father.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Holy Ghost appeared in a bodily shape like a dove, and the voice of the Father was heard:<br />
* This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The heavens were opened unto him, and, lo, the voice of the Father was heard, like unto thunder, saying:<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the grace of the  Holy Spirit enlighten all our hearts and minds. Amen. <br />

<span class="ri">Rom 9:11-16</span><br />
<span class="w">11</span> For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil that the purpose of God, according to election, might stand,<br />
<span class="w">12</span> Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid.<br />
<span class="w">15</span> For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy; and I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
