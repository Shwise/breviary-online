<span class="w">6:5</span>  Turn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul: * O save me for thy mercyâ€™s sake.<br />
<span class="w">6:6</span>  For there is no one in death, that is mindful of thee: * and who shall confess to thee in hell?<br />
<span class="w">6:7</span>  I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: * I will water my couch with my tears.<br />
<span class="w">6:8</span>  My eye is troubled through indignation: * I have grown old amongst all my enemies.<br />

<span class="w">7:14</span>  And in it he hath prepared the instruments of death, * he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.<br />
<span class="w">7:15</span>  Behold he hath been in labour with injustice; * he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">7:16</span>  He hath opened a pit and dug it: * and he is fallen into the hole he made.<br />
<span class="w">7:17</span>  His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: * and his iniquity shall come down upon his crown.<br />
<span class="w">7:18</span>  I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice: * and will sing to the name of the Lord the most High.<br />

Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
