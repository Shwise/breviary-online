<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">W</i>hy, impious Herod, vainly fear<br />
That Christ the Saviour cometh here?<br />
He takes no earthly realms away<br />
Who gives the crown that lasts for aye.<br />
 <br />
To greet His birth the Wise Men went,<br />
Led by the star before them sent;<br />
Called on by light, towards light they pressed,<br />
And by their gifts their God confessed.<br />
 <br />
In holy Jordan's purest wave<br />
The heavenly Lamb vouchsafed to lave;<br />
That He, to whom was sin unknown,<br />
Might cleanse His people from their own.<br />
 <br />
New miracle of power divine!<br />
The water reddens into wine:<br />
He spake the word: and poured the wave<br />
In other streams than nature gave.<br />
 <br />
All glory, Lord, to thee we pay<br />
For thine Epiphany to-day:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To Father and to Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<b>Reading 1</b><br />
Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans<br />
<span class="ri">Rom 13:1-4</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> Let every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of God.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> For he is God's minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
