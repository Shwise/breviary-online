<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i> glorious lady! throned on high<br />
Above the star-illumined sky;<br />
Thereto ordained, thy bosom lent<br />
To thy Creator nourishment.<br />

Through thy sweet offspring we receive<br />
The bliss once lost through hapless Eve;<br />
And heaven to mortals open lies<br />
Now thou art portal of the skies.<br />
 <br />
Thou art the door of heaven's high King,<br />
Light's gateway fair and glistering;<br />
Life through a Virgin is restored;<br />
Ye ransomed nations, praise the Lord!<br />

All honour, laud, and glory be,<br />
O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee;<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To Father and to Paraclete.<br />
