<span class="w">46:2</span>  O clap your hands, all ye nations: * shout unto God with the voice of joy,<br />
<span class="w">46:3</span>  For the Lord is high, terrible: * a great king over all the earth.<br />
<span class="w">46:4</span>  He hath subdued the people under us; * and the nations under our feet.<br />

<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Sir 44:16-17</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>ehold an high priest, who in his days pleased God, and was found righteous, and in the time of wrath he was made a propitiation.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esu, the world’s Redeemer, O hear;<br />
thy bishops’ fadeless crown, draw near:<br />
Accept with gentlest love today<br />
The prayers and praises that we pay.<br />
 <br />
The meek confessor of thy name<br />
Today attained a glorious fame;<br />
Whose yearly feast, in solemn state,<br />
thy faithful people celebrate.<br />
 <br />
The world and all its boasted good,<br />
As vain and passing, he eschewed;<br />
And therefore with angelic bands,<br />
In endless joy forever stands.<br />
 <br />
Grant then that we, most gracious God,<br />
May follow in the steps he trod:<br />
And, at his prayer, thy servants free<br />
From stain of all iniquity.<br />
 <br />
* To thee, O Christ, our loving King,<br />
All glory, praise, and thanks we bring:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To Father and to Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The Lord guided the just in right paths.<br />
