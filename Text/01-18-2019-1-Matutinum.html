<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> Three in One, and One in Three,<br />
Who rulest all things mightily:<br />
Bow down to hear the songs of praise<br />
Which, freed from bonds of sleep, we raise.<br />
 <br />
While lingers yet the peace of night,<br />
We rouse us from our slumbers light:<br />
That might of instant prayer may win<br />
The healing balm for wounds of sin.<br />
 <br />
If, by the wiles of Satan caught, <br />
This night-time we have sinned in aught,<br />
That sin Thy glorious power to-day,<br />
From heaven descending, cleanse away.<br />
 <br />
Let naught impure our bodies stain,<br />
No laggard sloth our souls detain, <br />
No taint of sin our spirits know, <br />
To chill the fervor of their glow.<br />
 <br />
Wherefore, Redeemer grant that we<br />
Fulfilled with thine own light may be:<br />
That, in our course, from day to day,<br />
By no misdeed we fall away.<br />
 <br />
Grant this, O Father ever One<br />
With Christ, thy sole-begotten Son,<br />
And Holy Ghost, whom all adore, <br />
Reigning and blest forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord set up a testimony in Jacob: * and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(1-8)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:1</span>  Attend, O my people, to my law: * incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">77:2</span>  I will open my mouth in parables: * I will utter propositions from the beginning.<br />
<span class="w">77:3</span>  How great things have we heard and known, * and our fathers have told us.<br />
<span class="w">77:4</span>  They have not been hidden from their children, * in another generation.<br />
<span class="w">77:4</span>  Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, * and his wonders which he hath done.<br />
<span class="w">77:5</span>  And he set up a testimony in Jacob: * and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="w">77:5</span>  How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: * that another generation might know them.<br />
<span class="w">77:6</span>  The children that should be born and should rise up, * and declare them to their children.<br />
<span class="w">77:7</span>  That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: * and may seek his commandments.<br />
<span class="w">77:8</span>  That they may not become like their fathers, * a perverse and exasperating generation.<br />
<span class="w">77:8</span>  A generation that set not their heart aright: * and whose spirit was not faithful to God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord did wonderful things * in the sight of their fathers.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(9-16)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:9</span>  The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: * they have turned back in the day of battle.<br />
<span class="w">77:10</span>  They kept not the covenant of God: * and in his law they would not walk.<br />
<span class="w">77:11</span>  And they forgot his benefits, * and his wonders that he had shewn them.<br />
<span class="w">77:12</span>  Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, * in the field of Tanis.<br />
<span class="w">77:13</span>  He divided the sea and brought them through: * and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.<br />
<span class="w">77:14</span>  And he conducted them with a cloud by day: * and all the night with a light of fire.<br />
<span class="w">77:15</span>  He struck the rock in the wilderness: * and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.<br />
<span class="w">77:16</span>  He brought forth water out of the rock: * and made streams run down as rivers.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord did wonderful things in the sight of their fathers.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord opened * the doors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(17-31)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:17</span>  And they added yet more sin against him: * they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.<br />
<span class="w">77:18</span>  And they tempted God in their hearts, * by asking meat for their desires.<br />
<span class="w">77:19</span>  And they spoke ill of God: * they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?<br />
<span class="w">77:20</span>  Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, * and the streams overflowed.<br />
<span class="w">77:20</span>  Can he also give bread, * or provide a table for his people?<br />
<span class="w">77:21</span>  Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: * and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.<br />
<span class="w">77:22</span>  Because they believed not in God: * and trusted not in his salvation.<br />
<span class="w">77:23</span>  And he had commanded the clouds from above, * and had opened the doors of heaven.<br />
<span class="w">77:24</span>  And had rained down manna upon them to eat, * and had given them the bread of heaven.<br />
<span class="w">77:25</span>  Man ate the bread of angels: * he sent them provisions in abundance.<br />
<span class="w">77:26</span>  He removed the south wind from heaven: * and by his power brought in the southwest wind.<br />
<span class="w">77:27</span>  And he rained upon them flesh as dust: * and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.<br />
<span class="w">77:28</span>  And they fell in the midst of their camp, * round about their pavilions.<br />
<span class="w">77:29</span>  So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: * they were not defrauded of that which they craved.<br />
<span class="w">77:30</span>  As yet their meat was in their mouth: * and the wrath of God came upon them.<br />
<span class="w">77:31</span>  And he slew the fat ones amongst them, * and brought down the chosen men of Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord opened the doors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> God is their helper, * and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(32-41)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:32</span>  In all these things they sinned still: * and they believed not for his wondrous works.<br />
<span class="w">77:33</span>  And their days were consumed in vanity, * and their years in haste.<br />
<span class="w">77:34</span>  When he slew them, then they sought him: * and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.<br />
<span class="w">77:35</span>  And they remembered that God was their helper: * and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="w">77:36</span>  And they loved him with their mouth: * and with their tongue they lied unto him:<br />
<span class="w">77:37</span>  But their heart was not right with him: * nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.<br />
<span class="w">77:38</span>  But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: * and will not destroy them.<br />
<span class="w">77:38</span>  And many a time did he turn away his anger: * and did not kindle all his wrath.<br />
<span class="w">77:39</span>  And he remembered that they are flesh: * a wind that goeth and returneth not.<br />
<span class="w">77:40</span>  How often did they provoke him in the desert: * and move him to wrath in the place without water?<br />
<span class="w">77:41</span>  And they turned back and tempted God: * and grieved the holy one of Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> God is their helper, and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord redeemed them * from the hand of him that afflicted them.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(42-58)</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:42</span>  They remembered not his hand, * in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:<br />
<span class="w">77:43</span>  How he wrought his signs in Egypt, * and his wonders in the field of Tanis.<br />
<span class="w">77:44</span>  And he turned their rivers into blood, * and their showers that they might, not drink.<br />
<span class="w">77:45</span>  He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them: * and frogs which destroyed them.<br />
<span class="w">77:46</span>  And he gave up their fruits to the blast, * and their labours to the locust.<br />
<span class="w">77:47</span>  And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, * and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.<br />
<span class="w">77:48</span>  And he gave up their cattle to the hail, * and their stock to the fire.<br />
<span class="w">77:49</span>  And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: * indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.<br />
<span class="w">77:50</span>  He made a way for a path to his anger: * he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.<br />
<span class="w">77:51</span>  And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: * the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.<br />
<span class="w">77:52</span>  And he took away his own people as sheep: * and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br />
<span class="w">77:53</span>  And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: * and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br />
<span class="w">77:54</span>  And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: * the mountain which his right hand had purchased.<br />
<span class="w">77:54</span>  And he cast out the Gentiles before them: * and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.<br />
<span class="w">77:55</span>  And he made the tribes of Israel * to dwell in their tabernacles.<br />
<span class="w">77:56</span>  Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: * and they kept not his testimonies.<br />
<span class="w">77:57</span>  And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: * even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.<br />
<span class="w">77:58</span>  They provoked him to anger on their hills: * and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> God built * his sanctuary in the earth.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(59-72)</span><em> [6]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:59</span>  God heard, and despised them, * and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.<br />
<span class="w">77:60</span>  And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, * his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.<br />
<span class="w">77:61</span>  And he delivered their strength into captivity: * and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.<br />
<span class="w">77:62</span>  And he shut up his people under the sword: * and he despised his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">77:63</span>  Fire consumed their young men: * and their maidens were not lamented.<br />
<span class="w">77:64</span>  Their priests fell by the sword: * and their widows did not mourn.<br />
<span class="w">77:65</span>  And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, * and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.<br />
<span class="w">77:66</span>  And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: * he put them to an everlasting reproach.<br />
<span class="w">77:67</span>  And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: * and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:<br />
<span class="w">77:68</span>  But he chose the tribe of Juda, * mount Sion which he loved.<br />
<span class="w">77:69</span>  And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land * which he founded for ever.<br />
<span class="w">77:70</span>  And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: * he brought him from following the ewes great with young,<br />
<span class="w">77:71</span>  To feed Jacob his servant, * and Israel his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">77:72</span>  And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: * and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Help us, O God, our Saviour, * deliver us: and forgive us our sins.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 78</span><em> [7]</em><br />
<span class="w">78:1</span>  O God, the heathens are come into thy inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: * they have made Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit.<br />
<span class="w">78:2</span>  They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: * the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">78:3</span>  They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem, * and there was none to bury them.<br />
<span class="w">78:4</span>  We are become a reproach to our neighbours: * a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.<br />

<span class="w">80:4</span>  Blow up the trumpet on the new moon, * on the noted day of your solemnity.<br />
<span class="w">80:5</span>  For it is a commandment in Israel, * and a judgment to the God of Jacob.<br />
<span class="w">80:6</span>  He ordained it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the land of Egypt: * he heard a tongue which he knew not.<br />
<span class="w">80:7</span>  He removed his back from the burdens: * his hands had served in baskets.<br />
<span class="w">80:8</span>  Thou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee: * I heard thee in the secret place of tempest: I proved thee at the waters of contradiction.<br />

Lesson from the first letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians<br />
<span class="ri">1 Cor 13:1-3</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> If I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify thy Name for evermore.<br />
* For great is thy mercy, O Lord, toward me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Thou art my God, and I will praise thee; Thou art my God, and I will exalt thee.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For great is thy mercy, O Lord, toward me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May Christ to all His people give, for ever in His sight to live. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">1 Cor 13:4-10</span><br />
<span class="w">4</span> Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely; is not puffed up;<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil;<br />
<span class="w">6</span> Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth;<br />
<span class="w">7</span> Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void, or tongues shall cease, or knowledge shall be destroyed.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> Great, O Lord, is thy mercy toward me.<br />
* And Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> In the day of my trouble I called upon thee, for Thou hast heard me.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.<br />

<span class="w">11</span> When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.<br />
<span class="w">12</span> We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now I know in part; but then I shall know even as I am known.<br />
