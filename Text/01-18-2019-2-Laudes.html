<span class="w">98:2</span>  The Lord is great in Sion, * and high above all people.<br />
<span class="w">98:3</span>  Let them give praise to thy great name: for it is terrible and holy: * and the king’s honour loveth judgment.<br />

<span class="w">142:2</span>  And enter not into judgment with thy servant: * for in thy sight no man living shall be justified.<br />
<span class="w">142:3</span>  For the enemy hath persecuted my soul: * he hath brought down my life to the earth.<br />
<span class="w">142:4</span>  He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been dead of old: * and my spirit is in anguish within me: my heart within me is troubled.<br />

<span class="w">45:17</span>  Israel is saved in the Lord with an eternal salvation: * you shall not be confounded, and you shall not be ashamed for ever and ever.<br />
<span class="w">45:18</span>  For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens, * God himself that formed the earth, and made it, the very maker thereof:<br />
<span class="w">45:19</span>  He did not create it in vain: he formed it to be inhabited. * I am the Lord, and there is no other.<br />

<span class="w">45:27</span>  I have sworn by myself, the word of justice shall go out of my mouth, * and shall not return:<br />
<span class="w">45:28</span>  For every knee shall be bowed to me, * and every tongue shall swear.<br />
<span class="w">45:29</span>  Therefore shall he say: In the Lord are my justices and empire: * they shall come to him, and all that resist him shall be confounded.<br />

<span class="w">147:7</span>  He shall send out his word, and shall melt them: * his wind shall blow, and the waters shall run.<br />
<span class="w">147:8</span>  Who declareth his word to Jacob: * his justices and his judgments to Israel.<br />
<span class="w">147:9</span>  He hath not done in like manner to every nation: * and his judgments he hath not made manifest to them.<br />

<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i> Christ, whose glory fills the heaven,<br />
Our only hope, in mercy given;<br />
Child of a Virgin meek and pure;<br />
Son of the Highest evermore:<br />
 <br />
Grant us thine aid thy praise to sing,<br />
As opening days new duties bring; <br />
That with the light our life may be<br />
Renewed and sanctified by thee.<br />
 <br />
The morning star fades from the sky,<br />
The sun breaks forth; night’s shadows fly:<br />
O Thou, true Light, upon us shine:<br />
Our darkness turn to light divine.<br />
 <br />
Within us grant thy light to dwell;<br />
And from our souls dark sins expel;<br />
Cleanse thou our minds from stain of ill,<br />
And with thy peace our bosoms fill.<br />
 <br />
To us strong faith forever give,<br />
With joyous hope, in thee to live;<br />
That life’s rough way may ever be<br />
Made strong and pure by charity.<br />
 <br />
All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete,<br />
Amen.<br />
