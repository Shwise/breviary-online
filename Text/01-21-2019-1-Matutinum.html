<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>on of a virgin, maker of thy mother,<br />
Thou, rod and blossom from a stem unstainèd,<br />
Now while a virgin fair of fame we honour,<br />
Hear our devotion!<br />
 <br />
Lo, on thy handmaid fell a two-fold blessing,<br />
Who, in her body vanquishing the weakness,<br />
In that same body, grace from heaven obtaining,<br />
Bore the world witness.<br />
 <br />
Death, nor the rending pains of death appalled her;<br />
Bondage and torment found her undefeated:<br />
So by the shedding of her blood attained she<br />
Heavenly guerdon.<br />
 <br />
Fountain of mercy, hear the prayers she offers;<br />
Purge our offences, pardon our transgressions,<br />
So that hereafter we to thee may render<br />
Praise with thanksgiving.<br />
 <br />
Thou, the All-Father, thou, the One-Begotten,<br />
Thou, Holy Spirit, Three in One co-equal,<br />
Glory be henceforth thine through all the ages,<br />
World without ending.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">1:5</span>  Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: * nor sinners in the council of the just.<br />
<span class="w">1:6</span>  For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: * and the way of the wicked shall perish.<br />

<span class="w">3:4</span>  But thou, O Lord art my protector, * my glory, and the lifter up of my head.<br />
<span class="w">3:5</span>  I have cried to the Lord with my voice: * and he hath heard me from his holy hill.<br />

<span class="w">2</span> I will give glory to thy name: for thou hast been a helper and protector to me.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And hast preserved my body from destruction, from the snare of an unjust tongue, and from the lips of them that forge lies, and in the sight of them that stood by, thou hast been my helper.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And thou hast delivered me, according to the multitude of the mercy of thy name, from them that did roar, prepared to devour.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Out of the hands of them that sought my life, and from the gates of afflictions, which compassed me about:<br />

<span class="w">8</span> My soul shall praise the Lord even to death. <br />
<span class="w">9</span> And my life was drawing near to hell beneath. <br />
<span class="w">10</span> They compassed me on every side, and there was no one that would help me. I looked for the succour of men, and there was none.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy works, which are from the beginning of the world. <br />
<span class="w">12</span> How thou deliverest them that wait for thee, O Lord, and savest them out of the hands of the nations. <br />
<span class="ri">Sir 51:13-17</span><br />
<span class="w">13</span> Thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and I have prayed for death to pass away. <br />
<span class="w">14</span> I called upon the Lord, the father of my Lord, that he would not leave me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the proud without help. <br />
<span class="w">15</span> I will praise thy name continually, and will praise it with thanksgiving, and my prayer was heard.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> And thou hast saved me from destruction, and hast delivered me from the evil time. <br />
<span class="w">17</span> Therefore I will give thanks, and praise thee, and bless the name of the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Christ is my Lover, and I am entering with Him into the marriagechamber. His Mother is a Virgin, and His Father knoweth not a woman. The instruments of His music sound sweetly together in my ears.<br />
* If I love Him I shall be chaste, if I touch Him I shall be clean, if I embrace Him I shall be a virgin indeed.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> He hath espoused me with a betrothal ring, and adorned me with a necklace of great price.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> If I love Him I shall be chaste, if I touch Him I shall be clean, if I embrace Him I shall be a virgin indeed.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> If I love Him, I shall be chaste, if I touch Him I shall be clean, if I embrace Him I shall be a virgin indeed.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
From the book of St. Ambrose, Bishop, on Virgins<br />
<span class="ri">Book I, near the beginning</span><br />
Today is the birthday of a Virgin; let us imitate her virginal innocence. It is the birthday of a Martyr; let us also bring sacrifice. It is the birthday of St. Agnes; let men look up in admiration and children not be disheartened. You married, be filled with wonder; you unmarried, follow in her footsteps. But where shall we find words of adequate praise, since her very name bespeaks her glory and renown? In her we see a devotion that far surpasses her age; a virtue that exceeds all Power of nature. Hence, it seems to me that she had not merely a human name, but, prophetically, she was given the name of a Martyr to indicate beforehand what she was to be. The name of our Virgin to a guarantee of her purity. If I call her Martyr, already I have praised enough. For, that is great praise indeed, which one does not need to seek but is freely given by others. No one can be more praised than one who is praised by all. As many men, so many encomiums. They have only to mention her name to praise her as a Martyr. According to tradition, it was in her thirteenth year that she suffered martyrdom. How despicable the cruelty that spared not even this tender age! But how great the power of faith that found even that age its witness.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<span class="ri">During the following verse, by local custom, all make a profound bow.</span><br />
And we worship thy Name * ever, world without end.<br />
 <br />
Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us * this day without sin.<br />
O Lord, have mercy upon us, * have mercy upon us.<br />
O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us, * as our trust is in thee.<br />
O Lord, in thee have I trusted, * let me never be confounded.<br />
