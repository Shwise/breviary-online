<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> strength and stay upholding all creation,<br />
Who ever dost thyself unmoved abide,<br />
Yet day by day the light in due gradation<br />
From hour to hour through all its changes guide:<br />
 <br />
Grant to life’s day a calm unclouded ending,<br />
An eve untouched by shadows of decay,<br />
The brightness of a holy death-bed blending<br />
With dawning glories of th’ eternal day.<br />
 <br />
* Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,<br />
And thou, O Christ, the co-eternal Word,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living<br />
Now and to endless ages art adored.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">58:3</span>  Deliver me from them that work iniquity, * and save me from bloody men.<br />
<span class="w">58:4</span>  For behold they have caught my soul: * the mighty have rushed in upon me:<br />
<span class="w">58:5</span>  Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord: * without iniquity have I run, and directed my steps.<br />
<span class="w">58:6</span>  Rise up thou to meet me, and behold: * even thou, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">58:6</span>  Attend to visit all the nations: * have no mercy on all them that work iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">58:7</span>  They shall return at evening, and shall suffer hunger like dogs: * and shall go round about the city.<br />
<span class="w">58:8</span>  Behold they shall speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips: * for who, say they, hath heard us?<br />

<span class="w">58:13</span>  For the sin of their mouth, and the word of their lips: * and let them be taken in their pride.<br />
<span class="w">58:13</span>  And for their cursing and lying they shall be talked of, when they are consumed: * when they are consumed by thy wrath, and they shall be no more.<br />

<span class="w">59:7</span>  That thy beloved may be delivered. * Save me with thy right hand, and hear me.<br />
<span class="w">59:8</span>  God hath spoken in his holy place: * I will rejoice, and I will divide Sichem; and will mete out the vale of tabernacles.<br />
<span class="w">59:9</span>  Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: * and Ephraim is the strength of my head.<br />
<span class="w">59:9</span>  Juda is my king: * Moab is the pot of my hope.<br />
