<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i>ur souls' great teacher, Paul, our guide in wisdom's ways,<br />
Teach us, our fainting hearts, to heaven's glad clime to raise,<br />
Till faith in clearest light her bright meridian gains,<br />
And love with sun-like fire within each bosom reigns.<br />
 <br />
All honour, might, and power, and hymns of joy we bring,<br />
While to the Trinity eternal praise we sing;<br />
He rules the universe in wondrous Unity,<br />
And shall, throughout the days of all eternity.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 18</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">18:2</span>  The heavens shew forth the glory of God, * and the firmament declareth the work of his hands.<br />
<span class="w">18:3</span>  Day to day uttereth speech, * and night to night sheweth knowledge.<br />
<span class="w">18:4</span>  There are no speeches nor languages, * where their voices are not heard.<br />
<span class="w">18:5</span>  Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: * and their words unto the ends of the world.<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: * and he, as a bridegroom coming out of his bride chamber,<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,<br />
<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">18:9</span>  The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">18:10</span>  The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.<br />
<span class="w">18:11</span>  More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br />
<span class="w">18:12</span>  For thy servant keepeth them, * and in keeping them there is a great reward.<br />
<span class="w">18:13</span>  Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: * and from those of others spare thy servant.<br />
<span class="w">18:14</span>  If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  O Lord, my helper, * and my redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">33:4</span>  O magnify the Lord with me; * and let us extol his name together.<br />
<span class="w">33:5</span>  I sought the Lord, and he heard me; * and he delivered me from all my troubles.<br />
<span class="w">33:6</span>  Come ye to him and be enlightened: * and your faces shall not be confounded.<br />
<span class="w">33:7</span>  This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him: * and saved him out of all his troubles.<br />
<span class="w">33:8</span>  The Angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him: * and shall deliver them.<br />
<span class="w">33:9</span>  O taste, and see that the Lord is sweet: * blessed is the man that hopeth in him.<br />
<span class="w">33:10</span>  Fear the Lord, all ye his saints: * for there is no want to them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">33:11</span>  The rich have wanted, and have suffered hunger: * but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good.<br />
<span class="w">33:12</span>  Come, children, hearken to me: * I will teach you the fear of the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">33:13</span>  Who is the man that desireth life: * who loveth to see good days?<br />
<span class="w">33:14</span>  Keep thy tongue from evil, * and thy lips from speaking guile.<br />
<span class="w">33:15</span>  Turn away from evil and do good: * seek after peace and pursue it.<br />
<span class="w">33:16</span>  The eyes of the Lord are upon the just: * and his ears unto their prayers.<br />
<span class="w">33:17</span>  But the countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil things: * to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.<br />
<span class="w">33:18</span>  The just cried, and the Lord heard them: * and delivered them out of all their troubles.<br />
<span class="w">33:19</span>  The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: * and he will save the humble of spirit.<br />
<span class="w">33:20</span>  Many are the afflictions of the just; * but out of them all will the Lord deliver them.<br />
<span class="w">33:21</span>  The Lord keepeth all their bones, * not one of them shall be broken.<br />
<span class="w">33:22</span>  The death of the wicked is very evil: * and they that hate the just shall be guilty.<br />
<span class="w">33:23</span>  The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants: * and none of them that trust in him shall offend.<br />

<span class="w">44:2</span>  My heart hath uttered a good word; * I speak my works to the King.<br />
<span class="w">44:2</span>  My tongue is the pen of a scrivener * that writeth swiftly.<br />

<span class="w">44:4</span>  Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, * O thou most mighty.<br />
<span class="w">44:5</span>  With thy comeliness and thy beauty * set out, proceed prosperously, and reign.<br />
<span class="w">44:5</span>  Because of truth and meekness and justice: * and thy right hand shall conduct thee wonderfully.<br />

<span class="w">44:8</span>  Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: * therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br />
<span class="w">44:9</span>  Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: * out of which the daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory.<br />
<span class="w">44:10</span>  The queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; * surrounded with variety.<br />
<span class="w">44:11</span>  Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thy ear: * and forget thy people and thy father’s house.<br />

Lesson from the Acts of the Apostles<br />
<span class="ri">Acts 9:1-5</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> And Saul, as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,<br />
<span class="w">2</span> And asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues: that if he found any men and women of this way, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And as he went on his journey, it came to pass that he drew nigh to Damascus; and suddenly a light from heaven shined round about him.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying to him: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Who said: Who art thou, Lord? And he: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> He That wrought effectually in Peter to the Apostleship, the Same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles,<br />
* And they perceived the grace that was given unto me of the Lord Christ.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The grace of God which was bestowed upon me was not in vain, but His grace abideth ever in me.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And they perceived the grace that was given unto me of the Lord Christ.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>He whose feast-day we are keeping, be our Advocate with God. Amen. <br />

<span class="ri">Acts 9:6-9</span><br />
<span class="w">6</span> And he trembling and astonished, said: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?<br />
<span class="w">7</span> And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the city, and there it shall be told thee what thou must do. Now the men who went in company with him, stood amazed, hearing indeed a voice, but seeing no man.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> And Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. But they leading him by the hands, brought him to Damascus.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> And he was there three days, without sight, and he did neither eat nor drink.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith;<br />
* Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> I know Whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.<br />

<span class="ri">Acts 9:10-16</span><br />
<span class="w">10</span> Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision: Ananias. And he said: Behold I am here, Lord.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the street that is called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas, one named Saul of Tarsus. For behold he prayeth.<br />
<span class="w">12</span> And he saw a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hands upon him, that he might receive his sight.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> But Ananias answered: Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints in Jerusalem.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that invoke thy name.<br />
<span class="w">15</span> And the Lord said to him: Go thy way; for this man is to me a vessel of election, to carry my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.<br />
