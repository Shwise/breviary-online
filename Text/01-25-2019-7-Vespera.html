<br />
<span class="ri">Acts 9:1-2</span><br />
<i class="a">A</i>nd Saul, as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, and asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues: that if he found any men and women of this way, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.<br />

<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i>ur souls' great teacher, Paul, our guide in wisdom's ways,<br />
Teach us, our fainting hearts, to heaven's glad clime to raise,<br />
Till faith in clearest light her bright meridian gains,<br />
And love with sun-like fire within each bosom reigns.<br />
 <br />
All honour, might, and power, and hymns of joy we bring,<br />
While to the Trinity eternal praise we sing;<br />
He rules the universe in wondrous Unity,<br />
And shall, throughout the days of all eternity.<br />
Amen.<br />
