<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>on of a virgin, maker of thy mother,<br />
Thou, rod and blossom from a stem unstainèd,<br />
Now while a virgin fair of fame we honour,<br />
Hear our devotion!<br />
 <br />
Lo, on thy handmaid fell a two-fold blessing,<br />
Who, in her body vanquishing the weakness,<br />
In that same body, grace from heaven obtaining,<br />
Bore the world witness.<br />
 <br />
Death, nor the rending pains of death appalled her;<br />
Bondage and torment found her undefeated:<br />
So by the shedding of her blood attained she<br />
Heavenly guerdon.<br />
 <br />
Fountain of mercy, hear the prayers she offers;<br />
Purge our offences, pardon our transgressions,<br />
So that hereafter we to thee may render<br />
Praise with thanksgiving.<br />
 <br />
Thou, the All-Father, thou, the One-Begotten,<br />
Thou, Holy Spirit, Three in One co-equal,<br />
Glory be henceforth thine through all the ages,<br />
World without ending.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">1:4</span>  Not so the wicked, not so: * but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">1:5</span>  Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: * nor sinners in the council of the just.<br />
<span class="w">1:6</span>  For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: * and the way of the wicked shall perish.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 2</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">2:1</span>  Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?<br />
<span class="w">2:2</span>  The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, * against the Lord and against his Christ.<br />
<span class="w">2:3</span>  Let us break their bonds asunder: * and let us cast away their yoke from us.<br />
<span class="w">2:4</span>  He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: * and the Lord shall deride them.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 3</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">3:2</span>  Why, O Lord, are they multiplied that afflict me? * many are they who rise up against me.<br />
<span class="w">3:3</span>  Many say to my soul: * There is no salvation for him in his God.<br />
<span class="w">3:4</span>  But thou, O Lord art my protector, * my glory, and the lifter up of my head.<br />
<span class="w">3:5</span>  I have cried to the Lord with my voice: * and he hath heard me from his holy hill.<br />
<span class="w">3:6</span>  I have slept and taken my rest: * and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.<br />
<span class="w">3:7</span>  I will not fear thousands of the people, surrounding me: * arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.<br />
<span class="w">3:8</span>  For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause: * thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.<br />
<span class="w">3:9</span>  Salvation is of the Lord: * and thy blessing is upon thy people.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The holy Agatha * said: Dost thou promise me beasts? When they hear Christ's name they grow tame.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 4</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">4:2</span>  When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me: * when I was in distress, thou hast enlarged me.<br />
<span class="w">4:2</span>  Have mercy on me: * and hear my prayer.<br />
<span class="w">4:3</span>  O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? * Why do you love vanity, and seek after lying?<br />
<span class="w">4:4</span>  Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful: * the Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him.<br />
<span class="w">4:5</span>  Be ye angry, and sin not: * the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds.<br />
<span class="w">4:6</span>  Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord: * many say, Who sheweth us good things?<br />
<span class="w">4:7</span>  The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us: * thou hast given gladness in my heart.<br />
<span class="w">4:8</span>  By the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, * they are multiplied.<br />
<span class="w">4:9</span>  In peace in the selfsame * I will sleep, and I will rest:<br />

<span class="w">5:5</span>  In the morning I will stand before thee, and will see: * because thou art not a God that willest iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">5:6</span>  Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee: * nor shall the unjust abide before thy eyes.<br />
<span class="w">5:7</span>  Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity: * thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie.<br />

<span class="w">5:9</span>  Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice: * because of my enemies, direct my way in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">5:10</span>  For there is no truth in their mouth: * their heart is vain.<br />
<span class="w">5:11</span>  Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully with their tongues: * judge them, O God.<br />
<span class="w">5:11</span>  Let them fall from their devices: according to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out: * for they have provoked thee, O Lord.<br />

<span class="w">1</span> A prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. I will give glory to thee, O Lord, O King, and I will praise thee, O God my Saviour.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> I will give glory to thy name: for thou hast been a helper and protector to me.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And hast preserved my body from destruction, from the snare of an unjust tongue, and from the lips of them that forge lies, and in the sight of them that stood by, thou hast been my helper.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And thou hast delivered me, according to the multitude of the mercy of thy name, from them that did roar, prepared to devour.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Out of the hands of them that sought my life, and from the gates of afflictions, which compassed me about:<br />
<span class="w">6</span> From the oppression of the flame which surrounded me, and in the midst of the fire I was not burnt.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> From the depth of the belly of hell, and from an unclean tongue, and from lying words, from an unjust king, and from a slanderous tongue:<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
Agatha, born in Sicily of noble parents, suffered a glorious martyrdom at Catania In the persecution of the emperor Decius. For when Quintianus, the praetor of Sicily, had vainly tried every means to tempt her from her virginity, he had her arrested as adhering to the Christian superstition. First she was beaten,then tortured on the rack with white hot iron plates laid on her; then one of her breasts was cut off. Next she was thrown into prison, where St. Peter the Apostle appeared to her by night and healed her. Again called before the praetor she persevered in confessing Christ, and he had her rolled over broken pottery and burning coals. But then a great earthquake violently shook the city, and Quintianus, afraid of a riot among the people, gave orders that Agatha, now half dead, secretly be taken back to prison. There after a short time she went to heaven on February 5.<br />
