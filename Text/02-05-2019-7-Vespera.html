<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esu, the virgins' crown, do thou<br />
Accept us as in prayer we bow;<br />
Born of that Virgin, whom alone<br />
The mother and the maid we own.<br />
 <br />
Amongst the lilies thou dost feed,<br />
By virgin choirs accompanied; <br />
With glory decked, the spotless brides<br />
Whose bridal gifts thy love provides.<br />
 <br />
They, wheresoe'er thy footsteps bend,<br />
With hymns and praises still attend:<br />
In blessèd troops they follow thee,<br />
With dance, and song, and melody.<br />
 <br />
We pray thee therefore to bestow<br />
Upon our senses here below<br />
Thy grace, that so we may endure<br />
From taint of all corruption pure.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, eternal Son, to thee;<br />
All glory as is ever meet,<br />
To God, the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen. <br />
