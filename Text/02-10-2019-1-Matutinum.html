<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">H</i>ail day! whereon the One in Three<br />
First formed the earth by sure decree,<br />
The day its Maker rose again, <br />
And vanquished death, and burst our chain.<br />
 <br />
Away with sleep and slothful ease <br />
We raise our hearts and bend our knees,<br />
And early seek the Lord of all, <br />
Obedient to the Prophet's call.<br />
 <br />
That He may hearken to our prayer,<br />
Stretch forth His strong right arm to spare,<br />
And ev'ry past offense forgiven, <br />
Restore us to our home in heaven.<br />
 <br />
Assembled here this holy day,<br />
This holiest hour we raise the lay,<br />
And O that He to whom we sing,<br />
May now reward our offering!<br />
 <br />
O Father of unclouded light! <br />
Keep us this day as in thy sight, <br />
In word and deed that we may be <br />
From ev'ry touch of evil free.<br />
 <br />
That this our body's mortal frame <br />
May know no sin, and fear no shame,<br />
Nor fire hereafter be the end <br />
Of passions which our bosom rend.<br />
 <br />
Redeemer of the world, we pray <br />
That thou wouldst wash our sins away,<br />
And give us, of Thy boundless grace,<br />
The blessings of the heavenly place.<br />
 <br />
Most Holy Father, hear our cry, <br />
Through Jesus Christ our Lord most High<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee<br />
Shall live and reign eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">1:4</span>  Not so the wicked, not so: * but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">1:5</span>  Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: * nor sinners in the council of the just.<br />
<span class="w">1:6</span>  For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: * and the way of the wicked shall perish.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 2</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">2:1</span>  Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?<br />
<span class="w">2:2</span>  The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, * against the Lord and against his Christ.<br />
<span class="w">2:3</span>  Let us break their bonds asunder: * and let us cast away their yoke from us.<br />
<span class="w">2:4</span>  He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: * and the Lord shall deride them.<br />

<span class="w">2:6</span>  But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain, * preaching his commandment.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 3</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">3:2</span>  Why, O Lord, are they multiplied that afflict me? * many are they who rise up against me.<br />
<span class="w">3:3</span>  Many say to my soul: * There is no salvation for him in his God.<br />
<span class="w">3:4</span>  But thou, O Lord art my protector, * my glory, and the lifter up of my head.<br />
<span class="w">3:5</span>  I have cried to the Lord with my voice: * and he hath heard me from his holy hill.<br />
<span class="w">3:6</span>  I have slept and taken my rest: * and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.<br />

<span class="w">8:6</span>  Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour: * and hast set him over the works of thy hands.<br />
<span class="w">8:8</span>  Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, * all sheep and oxen: moreover the beasts also of the fields.<br />

Lesson from the first letter of St. Paul the Apostle to Timothy<br />
<span class="ri">1 Tim 1:1-4</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus our hope:<br />
<span class="w">2</span> To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise,<br />
<span class="w">4</span> Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies: which furnish questions rather than the edification of God, which is in faith.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thine hot displeasure.<br />
* Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and darkness hath overwhelmed me.<br />

<span class="ri">1 Tim 1:5-11</span><br />
<span class="w">5</span> Now the end of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> From which things some going astray, are turned aside unto vain babbling:<br />
<span class="w">7</span> Desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither the things they say, nor whereof they affirm.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully:<br />
<span class="w">9</span> Knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man, but for the unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly, and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,<br />
<span class="w">10</span> For fornicators, for them who defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and whatever other thing is contrary to sound doctrine,<br />
<span class="w">11</span> Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which hath been committed to my trust.<br />
<span class="ri">1 Tim 1:12-16</span><br />
<span class="w">12</span> I give thanks to him who hath strengthened me, even to Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he hath counted me faithful, putting me in the ministry;<br />
<span class="w">13</span> Who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and contumelious. But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.<br />
<span class="w">15</span> A faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> But for this cause have I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might shew forth all patience, for the information of them that shall believe in him unto life everlasting.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 13:24-30</span><br />
At that time, Jesus said to the people a parable: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seeds in his field. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Quest. Evang. Matth. xi, Bk. 4</span><br />
When the Shepherds of the Church wax careless, and since the Apostles sleep the sleep of death, cometh the devil, and soweth them whom the Lord calleth a seed of evil-doers. Now, are these seed of evil-doers the heretics, or Catholics of bad lives? It is possible to call even the heretics a seed of evil-doers because they have sprung up from the seed of the Gospel, and been begotten in the Name of Christ, though afterwards they have turned after crooked ways and lying doctrines.<br />
