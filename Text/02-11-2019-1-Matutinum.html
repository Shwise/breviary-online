<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>hee would we hymn, O spotless one,<br />
Blest Mother of a virgin Son,<br />
And as we chant thy praises meet,<br />
Do thou for us God's grace entreat.<br />
 <br />
Poor Adam's guilty heirs are we,<br />
His sin-infected progeny;<br />
But thou, for Christ's sake, we believe,<br />
From sins' infection hadst reprieve.<br />
 <br />
Thus, boast of mankind, free from sin<br />
In thy so glorious origin,<br />
The envious dragon, 'neath thy heel,<br />
On his crushed head Christ's might doth feel.<br />
 <br />
O flower of the human race,<br />
Who took'st away poor Eve's disgrace,<br />
Obtain for every wavering one<br />
To serve without reproach thy Son.<br />
 <br />
When that old serpent would beguile<br />
Our foolish hearts with sinful wile,<br />
Gain us the might to smite him down<br />
And win the blessed victor's crown.<br />
 <br />
* All honour, laud, and glory be,<br />
O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee,<br />
Whom with the Father we adore,<br />
And Holy Ghost, for evermore. <br />
Amen.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
About four years after the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, a girl named Bernadette asserted that she had seen the Immaculate Mother of God several times. The place of the apparition was a grotto of the cliff by the bank of the Gave river, near the town of Lourdes, France, in the diocese of Tarbes. The many great miracles which followed were evidence enough for any prudent and faithful Christian that the finger of God was there. The location of a hitherto unknown spring at the grotto had been revealed in one of the apparitions; and the miracles for which Lourdes became best known were those very frequent occasions when the sick regained their health after drinking the water of the spring. And so, as news of the benefits said to be received by the faithful at the holy grotto was spreading abroad and the number coming there was increasing day by day, the Bishop of Tarbes carried out an official investigation and then gave permission for the cult of the Immaculate Virgin at the grotto. Soon a church was built. Vast crowds of the faithful have come to Lourdes each year, and the name of the Immaculate Mother of God continueth to increase in glory all over the world. Adding to this glory are the events during the procession of the most Blessed Sacrament: year after year, among the sick brought to Lourdes from all parts of the world to ask health from the Lord through the intercession of his Immaculate Mother, many are immediately cured. Rightly influenced by these events, Pope Pius X extended to the Universal Church the feast already granted to certain places by Leo XIII.<br />
