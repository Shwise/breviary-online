<i class="a">A</i>rise, my love, my beautiful one, and come: My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, show me thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears.<br />

 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">L</i>o! Mary is exempt from stain of sin,<br />
Proclaims the Pontiff high;<br />
And earth applauding celebrates with joy<br />
Her triumph, far and nigh.<br />
 <br />
Unto a lowly timid maid she shows<br />
Her form in beauty fair,<br />
And the Immaculate Conception truth<br />
Her sacred lips declare.<br />
 <br />
O honoured cave, by Mary's smile adorned!<br />
O hallow'd rock, whence spring<br />
The living waters of a gushing stream,<br />
The gifts of life to bring.<br />
 <br />
And thither from the farmost bounds of earth<br />
The pilgrims wend their way,<br />
And suppliant around the Virgin's shrine<br />
Her powerful help they pray.<br />
 <br />
The sufferers' cry the Mother fondly hears,<br />
And grants the longed-for grace;<br />
And health restored, the pilgrim throng returns<br />
Unto its native place.<br />
 <br />
O Virgin! have compassion on our needs,<br />
Refresh us labouring on;<br />
Obtain for us the joys of heavenly life,<br />
When sorrow all is gone.<br />
 <br />
All praise and honour to the Father be,<br />
And to his only Son,<br />
And to the Spirit, Pow'r of both for aye,<br />
In Godhead ever One. <br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Holy Virgin, my praise by thee accepted be.<br />
