<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> God of truth, O Lord of might,<br />
Who orderest time and change aright,<br />
Who send’st the early morning ray,<br />
And light’st the glow of perfect day:<br />
 <br />
Extinguish thou each sinful fire,<br />
And banish every ill desire;<br />
And while thou keep’st the body whole,<br />
Shed forth thy peace upon the soul.<br />
 <br />
* Almighty Father, hear our cry,<br />
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 55</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">55:2</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; * all the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me.<br />
<span class="w">55:3</span>  My enemies have trodden on me all the day long; * for they are many that make war against me.<br />
<span class="w">55:4</span>  From the height of the day I shall fear: * but I will trust in thee.<br />
<span class="w">55:5</span>  In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust: * I will not fear what flesh can do against me.<br />
<span class="w">55:6</span>  All the day long they detested my words: * all their thoughts were against me unto evil.<br />
<span class="w">55:7</span>  They will dwell and hide themselves: * they will watch my heel.<br />
<span class="w">55:8</span>  As they have waited for my soul, for nothing shalt thou save them: * in thy anger thou shalt break the people in pieces.<br />
<span class="w">55:9</span>  O God, I have declared to thee my life: * thou hast set my tears in thy sight,<br />
<span class="w">55:9</span>  As also in thy promise. * Then shall my enemies be turned back.<br />
<span class="w">55:10</span>  In what day soever I shall call upon thee, * behold I know thou art my God.<br />
<span class="w">55:11</span>  In God will I praise the word, in the Lord will I praise his speech. * In God have I hoped, I will not fear what man can do to me.<br />
<span class="w">55:12</span>  In me, O God, are vows to thee, * which I will pay, praises to thee:<br />
<span class="w">55:13</span>  Because thou hast delivered my soul from death, my feet from falling: * that I may please in the sight of God, in the light of the living.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 56</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">56:2</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me: * for my soul trusteth in thee.<br />
<span class="w">56:2</span>  And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, * until iniquity pass away.<br />
<span class="w">56:3</span>  I will cry to God the most High; * to God who hath done good to me.<br />
<span class="w">56:4</span>  He hath sent from heaven and delivered me: * he hath made them a reproach that trod upon me.<br />
<span class="w">56:4</span>  God hath sent his mercy and his truth, * and he hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions. I slept troubled.<br />
<span class="w">56:5</span>  The sons of men, whose teeth are weapons and arrows, * and their tongue a sharp sword.<br />
<span class="w">56:6</span>  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, * and thy glory above all the earth.<br />
<span class="w">56:7</span>  They prepared a snare for my feet; * and they bowed down my soul.<br />
<span class="w">56:7</span>  They dug a pit before my face, * and they are fallen into it.<br />
<span class="w">56:8</span>  My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: * I will sing, and rehearse a psalm.<br />
<span class="w">56:9</span>  Arise, O my glory, arise psaltery and harp: * I will arise early.<br />
<span class="w">56:10</span>  I will give praise to thee, O Lord, among the people: * I will sing a psalm to thee among the nations.<br />
<span class="w">56:11</span>  For thy mercy is magnified even to the heavens: * and thy truth unto the clouds.<br />
<span class="w">56:12</span>  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: * and thy glory above all the earth.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 57</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">57:2</span>  If in very deed you speak justice: * judge right things, ye sons of men.<br />
<span class="w">57:3</span>  For in your heart you work iniquity: * your hands forge injustice in the earth.<br />
<span class="w">57:4</span>  The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from the womb: * they have spoken false things.<br />
<span class="w">57:5</span>  Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent: * like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ears:<br />
<span class="w">57:6</span>  Which will not hear the voice of the charmers; * nor of the wizard that charmeth wisely.<br />
<span class="w">57:7</span>  God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth: * the Lord shall break the grinders of the lions.<br />
<span class="w">57:8</span>  They shall come to nothing, like water running down; * he hath bent his bow till they be weakened.<br />
<span class="w">57:9</span>  Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away: * fire hath fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun.<br />
<span class="w">57:10</span>  Before your thorns could know the brier; he swalloweth them up, * as alive, in his wrath.<br />
<span class="w">57:11</span>  The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge: * he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.<br />
<span class="w">57:12</span>  And man shall say: If indeed there be fruit to the just: * there is indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
