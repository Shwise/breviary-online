<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Lord, * thou hast proved me, and known me.<span class="w"> ‡</span><br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 138(1-13)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">138:1</span>  Lord, thou hast proved me, and known me: * <span class="w">‡</span> thou hast known my sitting down, and my rising up.<br />
<span class="w">138:3</span>  Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off: * my path and my life thou hast searched out.<br />
<span class="w">138:4</span>  And thou hast foreseen all my ways: * for there is no speech on my tongue.<br />
<span class="w">138:5</span>  Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, the last and those of old: * thou hast formed me, and hast laid thy hand upon me.<br />
<span class="w">138:6</span>  Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me: * it is high, and I cannot reach to it.<br />
<span class="w">138:7</span>  Whither shall I go from thy spirit? * or whither shall I flee from thy face?<br />
<span class="w">138:8</span>  If I ascend into heaven, thou art there: * if I descend into hell, thou art present.<br />
<span class="w">138:9</span>  If I take my wings early in the morning, * and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea:<br />
<span class="w">138:10</span>  Even there also shall thy hand lead me: * and thy right hand shall hold me.<br />
<span class="w">138:11</span>  And I said: Perhaps darkness shall cover me: * and night shall be my light in my pleasures.<br />
<span class="w">138:12</span>  But darkness shall not be dark to thee, and night shall be light as the day: * the darkness thereof, and the light thereof are alike to thee.<br />
<span class="w">138:13</span>  For thou hast possessed my reins: * thou hast protected me from my mother’s womb.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Lord, thou hast proved me, and known me.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Wonderful are thy works * and my soul knoweth right well.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 138(14-24)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">138:14</span>  I will praise thee, for thou art fearfully magnified: * wonderful are thy works, and my soul knoweth right well.<br />
<span class="w">138:15</span>  My bone is not hidden from thee, which thou hast made in secret: * and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">138:16</span>  Thy eyes did see my imperfect being, and in thy book all shall be written: * days shall be formed, and no one in them<br />
<span class="w">138:17</span>  But to me thy friends, O God, are made exceedingly honourable: * their principality is exceedingly strengthened.<br />
<span class="w">138:18</span>  I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand: * I rose up and am still with thee.<br />
<span class="w">138:19</span>  If thou wilt kill the wicked, O God: * ye men of blood, depart from me:<br />
<span class="w">138:20</span>  Because you say in thought: * They shall receive thy cities in vain.<br />
<span class="w">138:21</span>  Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated thee: * and pined away because of thy enemies?<br />
<span class="w">138:22</span>  I have hated them with a perfect hatred: * and they are become enemies to me.<br />
<span class="w">138:23</span>  Prove me, O God, and know my heart: * examine me, and know my paths.<br />
<span class="w">138:24</span>  And see if there be in me the way of iniquity: * and lead me in the eternal way.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Wonderful are thy works and my soul knoweth right well.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Do not thou forsake me, * O Lord, the strength of my salvation.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 139</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">139:2</span>  Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: * rescue me from the unjust man.<br />
<span class="w">139:3</span>  Who have devised iniquities in their hearts: * all the day long they designed battles.<br />
<span class="w">139:4</span>  They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: * the venom of asps is under their lips.<br />
<span class="w">139:5</span>  Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the wicked: * and from unjust men deliver me.<br />
<span class="w">139:5</span>  Who have proposed to supplant my steps: * the proud have hidden a net for me.<br />
<span class="w">139:6</span>  And they have stretched out cords for a snare: * they have laid for me a stumbling block by the wayside.<br />
<span class="w">139:7</span>  I said to the Lord: Thou art my God: * hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication.<br />
<span class="w">139:8</span>  O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation: * thou hast overshadowed my head in the day of battle.<br />
<span class="w">139:9</span>  Give me not up, O Lord, from my desire to the wicked: * they have plotted against me; do not thou forsake me, lest they should triumph.<br />
<span class="w">139:10</span>  The head of them compassing me about: * the labour of their lips shall overwhelm them.<br />
<span class="w">139:11</span>  Burning coals shall fall upon them; thou wilt cast them down into the fire: * in miseries they shall not be able to stand.<br />
<span class="w">139:12</span>  A man full of tongue shall not be established in the earth: * evil shall catch the unjust man unto destruction.<br />
<span class="w">139:13</span>  I know that the Lord will do justice to the needy, * and will revenge the poor.<br />
<span class="w">139:14</span>  But as for the just, they shall give glory to thy name: * and the upright shall dwell with thy countenance.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Do not thou forsake me, O Lord, the strength of my salvation.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> I have cried to thee, * O Lord, hear me.<span class="w"> ‡</span><br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 140</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">140:1</span>  I have cried to thee, O Lord, hear me: * <span class="w">‡</span> hearken to my voice, when I cry to thee.<br />
<span class="w">140:2</span>  Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight; * the lifting up of my hands, as evening sacrifice.<br />
<span class="w">140:3</span>  Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: * and a door round about my lips.<br />
<span class="w">140:4</span>  Incline not my heart to evil words; * to make excuses in sins.<br />
<span class="w">140:4</span>  With men that work iniquity: * and I will not communicate with the choicest of them.<br />
<span class="w">140:5</span>  The just man shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me: * but let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head.<br />
<span class="w">140:6</span>  For my prayer also shall still be against the things with which they are well pleased: * their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up.<br />
<span class="w">140:7</span>  They shall hear my words, for they have prevailed: * as when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground.<br />
<span class="w">140:8</span>  Our bones are scattered by the side of hell. * But to thee, O Lord, Lord, are my eyes: in thee have I put my trust, take not away my soul.<br />
<span class="w">140:9</span>  Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, * and from the stumbling blocks of them that work iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">140:10</span>  The wicked shall fall in his net: * I am alone until I pass.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Bring my soul * out of prison, O Lord, that I may praise thy name.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 141</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">141:2</span>  I cried to the Lord with my voice: * with my voice I made supplication to the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">141:3</span>  In his sight I pour out my prayer, * and before him I declare my trouble:<br />
<span class="w">141:4</span>  When my spirit failed me, * then thou knewest my paths.<br />
<span class="w">141:4</span>  In this way wherein I walked, * they have hidden a snare for me.<br />
<span class="w">141:5</span>  I looked on my right hand, and beheld, * and there was no one that would know me.<br />
<span class="w">141:5</span>  Flight hath failed me: * and there is no one that hath regard to my soul.<br />
<span class="w">141:6</span>  I cried to thee, O Lord: * I said: Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.<br />
<span class="w">141:7</span>  Attend to my supplication: * for I am brought very low.<br />
<span class="w">141:7</span>  Deliver me from my persecutors; * for they are stronger than I.<br />
<span class="w">141:8</span>  Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: * the just wait for me, until thou reward me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<i class="a">M</i>aker of man, who from thy throne<br />
Dost order all things, God alone;<br />
By whose decree the teeming earth<br />
To reptile and to beast gave birth:<br />

Instinct with life at thy command,<br />
Are given subdued to humankind <br />
For service in their rank assigned.<br />

From all thy servants drive away <br />
Whate’er of thought impure to-day <br />
Hath been with open action blent, <br />
Or mingled with the heart’s intent.<br />

In heaven thine endless joys bestow,<br />
And grant thy gifts of grace below;<br />
From chains of strife our souls release,<br />
Bind fast the gentle bands of peace.<br />

Grant this, O Father, ever One<br />
With Christ, thy sole-begotten Son,<br />
Whom, with the Spirit we adore, <br />
One God, both now and evermore.<br />
