<b>Psalms</b> <em>{Laudes:2 Psalms and antiphons  from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> According to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 50</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.<br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">50:13</span>  Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br />
<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />
<span class="w">50:15</span>  I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.<br />
<span class="w">50:16</span>  Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 42</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">42:1</span>  Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from the nation that is not holy: * deliver me from the unjust and deceitful man.<br />
<span class="w">42:2</span>  For thou art God my strength: * why hast thou cast me off? and why do I go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me?<br />
<span class="w">42:3</span>  Send forth thy light and thy truth: * they have conducted me, and brought me unto thy holy hill, and into thy tabernacles.<br />
<span class="w">42:4</span>  And I will go in to the altar of God: * to God who giveth joy to my youth.<br />
<span class="w">42:5</span>  To thee, O God my God, I will give praise upon the harp: * why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?<br />
<span class="w">42:6</span>  Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: * the salvation of my countenance, and my God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">66:4</span>  Let people confess to thee, O God: * let all people give praise to thee.<br />
<span class="w">66:5</span>  Let the nations be glad and rejoice: * for thou judgest the people with justice, and directest the nations upon earth.<br />
<span class="w">66:6</span>  Let the people, O God, confess to thee: * let all the people give praise to thee: the earth hath yielded her fruit.<br />
<span class="w">66:7</span>  May God, our God bless us, may God bless us: * and all the ends of the earth fear him.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Canticle of Ezechias</span><em> [4]</em><br />
 <span class="w">(Canticle of Ezechias * Isa 38:10-23)</span> <br />
<span class="w">38:10</span>  I said: In the midst of my days * I shall go to the gates of hell:<br />
<span class="w">38:11</span>  I sought for the residue of my years. * I said: I shall not see the Lord God in the land of the living.<br />
<span class="w">38:12</span>  I shall behold man no more, * nor the inhabitant of rest.<br />
<span class="w">38:13</span>  My generation is at an end, and it is rolled away from me, * as a shepherd’s tent.<br />
<span class="w">38:14</span>  My life is cut off, as by a weaver: whilst I was yet but beginning, he cut me off: * from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me.<br />
<span class="w">38:15</span>  I hoped till morning, * as a lion so hath he broken all my bones:<br />
<span class="w">38:16</span>  From morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me. * I will cry like a young swallow, I will meditate like a dove:<br />
<span class="w">38:17</span>  My eyes are weakened * looking upward:<br />
<span class="w">38:18</span>  Lord, I suffer violence, answer thou for me. * What shall I say, or what shall he answer for me, whereas he himself hath done it?<br />
<span class="w">38:19</span>  I will recount to thee all my years * in the bitterness of my soul.<br />
<span class="w">38:20</span>  O Lord, if man’s life be such, and the life of my spirit be in such things as these, thou shalt correct me, and make me to live. * Behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter:<br />
<span class="w">38:21</span>  But thou hast delivered my soul that it should not perish, * thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.<br />
<span class="w">38:22</span>  For hell shall not confess to thee, neither shall death praise thee: * nor shall they that go down into the pit, look for thy truth.<br />
<span class="w">38:23</span>  The living, the living, he shall give praise to thee, as I do this day: * the father shall make thy truth known to the children.<br />
<span class="w">38:24</span>  O Lord, save me, and we will sing our psalms all the days of our life * in the house of the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">134:3</span>  Praise ye the Lord, for the Lord is good: * sing ye to his name, for it is sweet.<br />
<span class="w">134:4</span>  For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: * Israel for his own possession.<br />
<span class="w">134:5</span>  For I have known that the Lord is great, * and our God is above all gods.<br />
<span class="w">134:6</span>  Whatsoever the Lord pleased he hath done, in heaven, in earth, * in the sea, and in all the deeps.<br />
<span class="w">134:7</span>  He bringeth up clouds from the end of the earth: * he hath made lightnings for the rain.<br />
<span class="w">134:8</span>  He bringeth forth winds out of his stores: * He slew the firstborn of Egypt from man even unto beast.<br />
<span class="w">134:9</span>  He sent forth signs and wonders in the midst of thee, O Egypt: * upon Pharao, and upon all his servants.<br />
<span class="w">134:10</span>  He smote many nations, * and slew mighty kings:<br />
<span class="w">134:11</span>  Sehon king of the Amorrhites, and Og king of Basan, * and all the kingdoms of Chanaan.<br />
<span class="w">134:12</span>  And gave their land for an inheritance, * for an inheritance to his people Israel.<br />
<span class="w">134:13</span>  Thy name, O Lord, is for ever: * thy memorial, O Lord, unto all generations.<br />
<span class="w">134:14</span>  For the Lord will judge his people, * and will be entreated in favour of his servants.<br />
<span class="w">134:15</span>  The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, * the works of men’s hands.<br />
<span class="w">134:16</span>  They have a mouth, but they speak not: * they have eyes, but they see not.<br />
<span class="w">134:17</span>  They have ears, but they hear not: * neither is there any breath in their mouths.<br />
<span class="w">134:18</span>  Let them that make them be like to them: * and every one that trusteth in them.<br />
<span class="w">134:19</span>  Bless the Lord, O house of Israel: * bless the Lord, O house of Aaron.<br />
<span class="w">134:20</span>  Bless the Lord, O house of Levi: * you that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">134:21</span>  Blessed be the Lord out of Sion, * who dwelleth in Jerusalem.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">A</i>s the bird, whose clarion gay <br />
Sounds before the dawn is grey,<br />
Christ, who brings the spirit’s day, <br />
Calls us, close at hand:<br />
 <br />
Wake! he cries, and for my sake,<br />
From your eyes dull slumbers shake!<br />
Sober, righteous, chaste, awake! <br />
At the door I stand!<br />
 <br />
Lord, to thee we lift on high<br />
Fervent prayer and bitter cry:<br />
Hearts aroused to pray and sigh <br />
May not slumber more:<br />
 <br />
Break the sleep of death and time, <br />
Forged by Adam’s ancient crime; <br />
And the light of Eden’s prime <br />
To the world restore!<br />
 <br />
Unto God the Father, Son, <br />
Holy Spirit, Three in One, <br />
One in Three, be glory done,<br />
Now and evermore.<br />
Amen.<br />
