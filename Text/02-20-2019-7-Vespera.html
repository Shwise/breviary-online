<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i> God, whose hand hath spread the sky,<br />
And all its shining hosts on high,<br />
And painting it with fiery light,<br />
Made it so beauteous and so bright:<br />
 <br />
Thou, when the fourth day was begun,<br />
Didst frame the circle of the sun, <br />
And set the moon for ordered change,<br />
And planets for their wider range:<br />
 <br />
To night and day, by certain line, <br />
Their varying bounds thou didst assign;<br />
And gav’st a signal, known and meet,<br />
For months begun and months complete.<br />
 <br />
Enlighten thou the hearts of men:<br />
Polluted souls make pure again:<br />
Unloose the bands of guilt within:<br />
Remove the burden of our sin.<br />
 <br />
Grant this, O Father, ever One<br />
With Christ thy sole-begotten Son,<br />
Whom, with the Spirit we adore, <br />
One God, both now and evermore.<br />
Amen.<br />
