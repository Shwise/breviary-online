<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> God of truth, O Lord of might,<br />
Who orderest time and change aright,<br />
Who send’st the early morning ray,<br />
And light’st the glow of perfect day:<br />
 <br />
Extinguish thou each sinful fire,<br />
And banish every ill desire;<br />
And while thou keep’st the body whole,<br />
Shed forth thy peace upon the soul.<br />
 <br />
* Almighty Father, hear our cry,<br />
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">103:1</span>  Bless the Lord, O my soul: * O Lord my God, thou art exceedingly great.<br />
<span class="w">103:1</span>  Thou hast put on praise and beauty: * and art clothed with light as with a garment.<br />
<span class="w">103:2</span>  Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion: * who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water.<br />
<span class="w">103:3</span>  Who makest the clouds thy chariot: * who walkest upon the wings of the winds.<br />
<span class="w">103:4</span>  Who makest thy angels spirits: * and thy ministers a burning fire.<br />
<span class="w">103:5</span>  Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: * it shall not be moved for ever and ever.<br />
<span class="w">103:6</span>  The deep like a garment is its clothing: * above the mountains shall the waters stand.<br />
<span class="w">103:7</span>  At thy rebuke they shall flee: * at the voice of thy thunder they shall fear.<br />
<span class="w">103:8</span>  The mountains ascend, and the plains descend * into the place which thou hast founded for them.<br />
<span class="w">103:9</span>  Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; * neither shall they return to cover the earth.<br />
<span class="w">103:10</span>  Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: * between the midst of the hills the waters shall pass.<br />
<span class="w">103:11</span>  All the beasts of the field shall drink: * the wild asses shall expect in their thirst.<br />
<span class="w">103:12</span>  Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: * from the midst of the rocks they shall give forth their voices.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 103(13-23)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">103:13</span>  Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: * the earth shall be filled with the fruit of thy works:<br />
<span class="w">103:14</span>  Bringing forth grass for cattle, * and herb for the service of men.<br />
<span class="w">103:14</span>  That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth: * and that wine may cheer the heart of man.<br />
<span class="w">103:15</span>  That he may make the face cheerful with oil: * and that bread may strengthen man’s heart.<br />
<span class="w">103:16</span>  The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted: * there the sparrows shall make their nests.<br />
<span class="w">103:17</span>  The highest of them is the house of the heron. * The high hills are a refuge for the harts, the rock for the irchins.<br />
<span class="w">103:19</span>  He hath made the moon for seasons: * the sun knoweth his going down.<br />
<span class="w">103:20</span>  Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night: * in it shall all the beasts of the woods go about:<br />
<span class="w">103:21</span>  The young lions roaring after their prey, * and seeking their meat from God.<br />
<span class="w">103:22</span>  The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together: * and they shall lie down in their dens.<br />

<span class="w">103:24</span>  How great are thy works, O Lord? * thou hast made all things in wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches.<br />
<span class="w">103:25</span>  So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: * there are creeping things without number:<br />
<span class="w">103:26</span>  Creatures little and great. * There the ships shall go.<br />
<span class="w">103:27</span>  This sea dragon which thou hast formed to play therein. * All expect of thee that thou give them food in season.<br />
<span class="w">103:28</span>  What thou givest to them they shall gather up: * when thou openest thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.<br />
<span class="w">103:29</span>  But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: * thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to their dust.<br />
<span class="w">103:30</span>  Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: * and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">103:31</span>  May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: * the Lord shall rejoice in his works.<br />
<span class="w">103:32</span>  He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: * he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.<br />
<span class="w">103:33</span>  I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: * I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.<br />
<span class="w">103:34</span>  Let my speech be acceptable to him: * but I will take delight in the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">103:35</span>  Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so that they be no more: * O my soul, bless thou the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
