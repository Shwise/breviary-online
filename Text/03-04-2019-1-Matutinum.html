<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>his the confessor of the Lord, whose triumph<br />
Now all the faithful celebrate, with gladness<br />
On this feast day year by year receiveth<br />
Merited honors.<br />
 <br />
Saintly and prudent, modest in behaviour,<br />
Peaceful and sober, chaste was he, and lowly.<br />
While that life’s vigour, coursing through his members,<br />
Quickened his being.<br />
 <br />
Sick ones of old time, to his tomb resorting,<br />
Sorely by ailments manifold afflicted,<br />
Oft-times have welcomed health and strength returning,<br />
At his petition.<br />
 <br />
Whence we in chorus gladly do him honour,<br />
Chanting his praises with devout affection,<br />
That in his merits we may have a portion,<br />
Now and forever.<br />
 <br />
His be the glory, power and salvation,<br />
Who over all things reigneth in the highest,<br />
Earth’s mighty fabric ruling and directing,<br />
Onely and Trinal.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven * upon the children of men.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 13</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  The fool hath said in his heart: * there is no God.<br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: * there is none that doth good, no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:2</span>  The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see if there be any that understand and seek God.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: * there is none that doth good: no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: * the poison of asps is under their lips.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; * their feet are swift to shed blood.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Destruction and unhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: * there is no fear of God before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">13:4</span>  Shall not all they know that work iniquity, * who devour my people as they eat bread?<br />
<span class="w">13:5</span>  They have not called upon the Lord: * there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.<br />
<span class="w">13:6</span>  For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man; * but the Lord is his hope.<br />
<span class="w">13:7</span>  Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? * when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> He who worketh justice * may rest on thy holy mountain, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 14</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">14:1</span>  Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest in thy holy hill?<br />
<span class="w">14:2</span>  He that walketh without blemish, * and worketh justice:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  He that speaketh truth in his heart, * who hath not used deceit in his tongue:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: * nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.<br />
<span class="w">14:4</span>  In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: * but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not; * He that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that doth these things, * shall not be moved for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> He who worketh justice may rest on thy holy mountain, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, incline * thy ear to me, and hear my voice, my Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 16</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">16:1</span>  Hear, O Lord, my justice: * attend to my supplication.<br />
<span class="w">16:1</span>  Give ear unto my prayer, * which proceedeth not from deceitful lips.<br />
<span class="w">16:2</span>  Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: * let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable.<br />
<span class="w">16:3</span>  Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, * thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.<br />
<span class="w">16:4</span>  That my mouth may not speak the works of men: * for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.<br />
<span class="w">16:5</span>  Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: * that my footsteps be not moved.<br />
<span class="w">16:6</span>  I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: * O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.<br />
<span class="w">16:7</span>  Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; * thou who savest them that trust in thee.<br />
<span class="w">16:8</span>  From them that resist thy right hand keep me, * as the apple of thy eye.<br />
<span class="w">16:9</span>  Protect me under the shadow of thy wings. * from the face of the wicked who have afflicted me.<br />
<span class="w">16:10</span>  My enemies have surrounded my soul: They have shut up their fat: * their mouth hath spoken proudly.<br />
<span class="w">16:11</span>  They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: * they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.<br />
<span class="w">16:12</span>  They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; * and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.<br />
<span class="w">16:13</span>  Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; * deliver my soul from the wicked one; thy sword from the enemies of thy hand.<br />
<span class="w">16:14</span>  O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: * their belly is filled from thy hidden stores.<br />
<span class="w">16:14</span>  They are full of children: * and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.<br />
<span class="w">16:15</span>  But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: * I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 17(2-16)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">17:2</span>  I will love thee, O Lord, my strength: * The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer.<br />
<span class="w">17:3</span>  My God is my helper, * and in him will I put my trust.<br />
<span class="w">17:3</span>  My protector, and the horn of my salvation, * and my support.<br />
<span class="w">17:4</span>  Praising, I will call upon the Lord: * and I shall be saved from my enemies.<br />
<span class="w">17:5</span>  The sorrows of death surrounded me: * and the torrents of iniquity troubled me.<br />
<span class="w">17:6</span>  The sorrows of hell encompassed me: * and the snares of death prevented me.<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  In my affliction I called upon the Lord, * and I cried to my God:<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  And he heard my voice from his holy temple: * and my cry before him came into his ears.<br />
<span class="w">17:8</span>  The earth shook and trembled: * the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them.<br />
<span class="w">17:9</span>  There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his face: * coals were kindled by it.<br />
<span class="w">17:10</span>  He bowed the heavens, and came down, * and darkness was under his feet.<br />
<span class="w">17:11</span>  And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; * he flew upon the wings of the winds.<br />
<span class="w">17:12</span>  And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him: * dark waters in the clouds of the air.<br />
<span class="w">17:13</span>  At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, * hail and coals of fire.<br />
<span class="w">17:14</span>  And the Lord thundered from heaven, * and the Highest gave his voice: * hail and coals of fire.<br />
<span class="w">17:15</span>  And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: * he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  Then the fountains of waters appeared, * and the foundations of the world were discovered:<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  At thy rebuke, O Lord, * at the blast of the spirit of thy wrath.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 17(17-35)</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">17:17</span>  He sent from on high, and took me: * and received me out of many waters.<br />
<span class="w">17:18</span>  He delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them that hated me: * for they were too strong for me.<br />
<span class="w">17:19</span>  They prevented me in the day of my affliction: * and the Lord became my protector.<br />
<span class="w">17:20</span>  And he brought me forth into a large place: * he saved me, because he was well pleased with me.<br />
<span class="w">17:21</span>  And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; * and will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:<br />
<span class="w">17:22</span>  Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; * and have not done wickedly against my God.<br />
<span class="w">17:23</span>  For all his judgments are in my sight: * and his justices I have not put away from me.<br />
<span class="w">17:24</span>  And I shall be spotless with him: * and shall keep myself from my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">17:25</span>  And the Lord will reward me according to my justice: * and according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.<br />
<span class="w">17:26</span>  With the holy thou wilt be holy; * and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent:<br />
<span class="w">17:27</span>  And with the elect thou wilt be elect: * and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted.<br />
<span class="w">17:28</span>  For thou wilt save the humble people; * but wilt bring down the eyes of the proud.<br />

Lesson from the book of Genesis<br />
<span class="ri">Gen 13:1-6</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And he returned by the way that he came, from the south to Bethel, to the place where before he had pitched his tent between Bethel and Hai:<br />
<span class="w">4</span> In the place of the altar which he had made before; and there he called upon the name of the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> But Lot also, who was with Abram, had flocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> Neither was the land able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, and they could not dwell together.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Abram removed his tent, and came, and dwelt by the vale of Mamre<br />
* And built there an altar unto the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And the Lord said unto him: Lift up thine eyes, and look; all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And built there an altar unto the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>He whose feast-day we are keeping, be our Advocate with God. Amen. <br />

<span class="ri">Gen 13:7-11</span><br />
<span class="w">7</span> Whereupon also there arose a strife between the herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And at that time the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled in that country.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be no quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen: for we are brethren.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> Behold the whole land is before thee: depart from me I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will take the right: if thou choose the right hand, I will pass to the left.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> And Lot, lifting up his eyes, saw all the country about the Jordan, which was watered throughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and like Egypt as one comes to Segor.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> And Lot chose to himself the country about the Jordan, and he departed from the east.<br />
<span class="ri">Gen 13:11-16</span><br />
<span class="w">11</span> And they were separated one brother from the other.<br />
<span class="w">12</span> Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan; and Lot abode in the towns that were about the Jordan, and dwelt in Sodom.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> And the men of Sodom were very wicked, and sinners before the face of the Lord, beyond measure.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him: Lift up thy eyes, and look from the place wherein thou now art, to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west.<br />
<span class="w">15</span> All the land which thou seest, I will give to thee, and to thy seed for ever.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Lord did tempt Abraham, and said unto him:<br />
* Take thy son Isaac whom thou lovest, and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And when the Lord called him, he answered Behold, here I am. And the Lord said unto him:<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Take thy son Isaac whom thou lovest, and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Take thy son Isaac whom thou lovest, and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
Casimir, son of the king of Poland, was brought up from his childhood in the love of God and in learning. He tamed his youthful body by wearing a hair-shirt, and weakened it with continual fasting. Indefatigable in contemplating the Passion of Christ, he never slackened in the spirit of prayer. He was most zealous in promoting the Catholic faith and in doing away with the schism of the Ruthenians. So helpful and kind was he to the poor and to all those afflicted by any calamity that he earned the name of father and defender of the needy. He preserved his virginity intact all his life. Made perfect in a short time, filled with grace and merits, he gave up his spirit to God on the day which he had foretold, in the twenty-fifth year of his age. He was famous for many miracles, and Leo X numbered him among the Saints.<br />
