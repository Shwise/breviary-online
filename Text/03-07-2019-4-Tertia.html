<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">C</i>ome Holy Ghost, who ever One<br />
Art with the Father and the Son,<br />
It is the hour, our souls possess<br />
With thy full flood of holiness.<br />
 <br />
Let flesh and heart and lips and mind<br />
Sound forth our witness to mankind;<br />
And love light up our mortal frame,<br />
Till others catch the living flame.<br />
 <br />
* Almighty Father, hear our cry,<br />
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />
<b>Psalms</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> How good is God * to Israel, to them that are of a right heart!<span class="w"> ‡</span><br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 72(1-9)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">72:1</span>  How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart! <br />
<span class="w">72:2</span>  <span class="w">‡</span> But my feet were almost moved; * my steps had wellnigh slipped.<br />
<span class="w">72:3</span>  Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, * seeing the prosperity of sinners.<br />
<span class="w">72:4</span>  For there is no regard to their death, * nor is there strength in their stripes.<br />
<span class="w">72:5</span>  They are not in the labour of men: * neither shall they be scourged like other men.<br />
<span class="w">72:6</span>  Therefore pride hath held them fast: * they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness.<br />
<span class="w">72:7</span>  Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: * they have passed into the affection of the heart.<br />
<span class="w">72:8</span>  They have thought and spoken wickedness: * they have spoken iniquity on high.<br />
<span class="w">72:9</span>  They have set their mouth against heaven: * and their tongue hath passed through the earth.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 72(10-17)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">72:10</span>  Therefore will my people return here * and full days shall be found in them.<br />
<span class="w">72:11</span>  And they said: How doth God know? * and is there knowledge in the most High?<br />
<span class="w">72:12</span>  Behold these are sinners; and yet abounding in the world * they have obtained riches.<br />
<span class="w">72:13</span>  And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, * and washed my hands among the innocent.<br />
<span class="w">72:14</span>  And I have been scourged all the day; * and my chastisement hath been in the mornings.<br />
<span class="w">72:15</span>  If I said: I will speak thus; * behold I should condemn the generation of thy children.<br />
<span class="w">72:16</span>  I studied that I might know this thing, * it is a labour in my sight:<br />
<span class="w">72:17</span>  Until I go into the sanctuary of God, * and understand concerning their last ends.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 72(18-28)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">72:18</span>  But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: * when they were lifted up, thou hast cast them down.<br />
<span class="w">72:19</span>  How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: * they have perished by reason of their iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">72:20</span>  As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; * so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.<br />
<span class="w">72:21</span>  For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed: * and I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.<br />
<span class="w">72:23</span>  I am become as a beast before thee: * and I am always with thee.<br />
<span class="w">72:24</span>  Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, * and with thy glory thou hast received me.<br />
<span class="w">72:25</span>  For what have I in heaven? * and besides thee what do I desire upon earth?<br />
<span class="w">72:26</span>  For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: * thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.<br />
<span class="w">72:27</span>  For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: * thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.<br />
<span class="w">72:28</span>  But it is good for me to adhere to my God, * to put my hope in the Lord God:<br />
<span class="w">72:28</span>  That I may declare all thy praises, * in the gates of the daughter of Sion.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart!<br />
