<span class="ri">Psalm 50</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.<br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">50:13</span>  Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br />
<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />

<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />

<span class="w">142:2</span>  And enter not into judgment with thy servant: * for in thy sight no man living shall be justified.<br />
<span class="w">142:3</span>  For the enemy hath persecuted my soul: * he hath brought down my life to the earth.<br />
<span class="w">142:4</span>  He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been dead of old: * and my spirit is in anguish within me: my heart within me is troubled.<br />
<span class="w">142:5</span>  I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all thy works: * I meditated upon the works of thy hands.<br />
<span class="w">142:6</span>  I stretched forth my hands to thee: * my soul is as earth without water unto thee.<br />
<span class="w">142:7</span>  Hear me speedily, O Lord: * my spirit hath fainted away.<br />

<span class="w">84:8</span>  Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; * and grant us thy salvation.<br />
<span class="w">84:9</span>  I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: * for he will speak peace<br />
<span class="w">84:9</span>  And unto his saints: * and unto them that are converted to the heart.<br />
<span class="w">84:10</span>  Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him: * that glory may dwell in our land.<br />
<span class="w">84:11</span>  Mercy and truth have met each other: * justice and peace have kissed.<br />
<span class="w">84:12</span>  Truth is sprung out of the earth: * and justice hath looked down from heaven.<br />
<span class="w">84:13</span>  For the Lord will give goodness: * and our earth shall yield her fruit.<br />

<span class="w">3:3</span>  O Lord, thy work, * in the midst of the years bring it to life:<br />
<span class="w">3:4</span>  In the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: * when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy.<br />

<span class="w">3:8</span>  There is his strength hid: * Death shall go before his face.<br />
<span class="w">3:9</span>  And the devil shall go forth before his feet. * He stood and measured the earth.<br />
<span class="w">3:10</span>  He beheld, and melted the nations: * and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces.<br />
<span class="w">3:11</span>  The hills of the world were bowed down * by the journeys of his eternity.<br />
<span class="w">3:12</span>  I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniquity, * the curtains of the land of Madian shall be troubled.<br />

<span class="w">3:18</span>  The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation, * in the light of thy arrows, they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering spear.<br />
<span class="w">3:19</span>  In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot: * in thy wrath thou wilt astonish the nations.<br />
<span class="w">3:20</span>  Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people: * for salvation with thy Christ.<br />
<span class="w">3:21</span>  Thou struckest the head of the house of the wicked: * thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck.<br />
<span class="w">3:22</span>  Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, * them that came out as a whirlwind to scatter me.<br />
<span class="w">3:23</span>  Their joy * was like that of him that devoureth the poor man in secret.<br />
