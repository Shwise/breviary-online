<span class="ri">Psalm 50</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.<br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />

<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />
<span class="w">50:15</span>  I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.<br />
<span class="w">50:16</span>  Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />

<span class="w">91:3</span>  To shew forth thy mercy in the morning, * and thy truth in the night:<br />
<span class="w">91:4</span>  Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery: * with a canticle upon the harp.<br />
<span class="w">91:5</span>  For thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in thy doings: * and in the works of thy hands I shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">91:6</span>  O Lord, how great are thy works! * thy thoughts are exceeding deep.<br />
<span class="w">91:7</span>  The senseless man shall not know: * nor will the fool understand these things.<br />

<span class="w">91:10</span>  For behold thy enemies, O Lord, for behold thy enemies shall perish: * and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.<br />
<span class="w">91:11</span>  But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn: * and my old age in plentiful mercy.<br />
<span class="w">91:12</span>  My eye also hath looked down upon my enemies: * and my ear shall hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me.<br />
<span class="w">91:13</span>  The just shall flourish like the palm tree: * he shall grow up like the cedar of Libanus.<br />

<span class="w">63:2</span>  Hear, O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee: * deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.<br />
<span class="w">63:3</span>  Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; * from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">63:4</span>  For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; * they have bent their bow a bitter thing, to shoot in secret the undefiled.<br />
<span class="w">63:6</span>  They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: * they are resolute in wickedness.<br />
<span class="w">63:6</span>  They have talked of hiding snares; * they have said: Who shall see them?<br />
<span class="w">63:7</span>  They have searched after iniquities: * they have failed in their search.<br />
<span class="w">63:7</span>  Man shall come to a deep heart: * and God shall be exalted.<br />
<span class="w">63:8</span>  The arrows of children are their wounds: * and their tongues against them are made weak.<br />
<span class="w">63:9</span>  All that saw them were troubled; * and every man was afraid.<br />
<span class="w">63:10</span>  And they declared the works of God: * and understood his doings.<br />
<span class="w">63:11</span>  The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: * and all the upright in heart shall be praised.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Canticle of Moses</span><em> [4]</em><br />
 <span class="w">(Canticle of Moses * Deut 32:1-27)</span> <br />
<span class="w">32:1</span>  Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, * let the earth give ear to the words of my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">32:2</span>  Let my doctrine gather as the rain, * let my speech distill as the dew,<br />
<span class="w">32:3</span>  As a shower upon the herb, and as drops upon the grass. * Because I will invoke the name of the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">32:4</span>  Give ye magnificence to our God. * The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are judgments:<br />
<span class="w">32:5</span>  God is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and right. * They have sinned against him, and are none of his children in their filth:<br />
<span class="w">32:6</span>  They are a wicked and perverse generation. * Is this the return thou makest to the Lord, O foolish and senseless people?<br />
<span class="w">32:7</span>  Is not he thy father, * that hath possessed thee, and made thee, and created thee?<br />
<span class="w">32:8</span>  Remember the days of old, * think upon every generation:<br />
<span class="w">32:9</span>  Ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: * thy elders and they will tell thee.<br />
<span class="w">32:10</span>  When the Most High divided the nations: * when he separated the sons of Adam,<br />
<span class="w">32:11</span>  He appointed the bounds of people * according to the number of the children of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">32:12</span>  But the Lord’s portion is his people: * Jacob the lot of his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">32:13</span>  He found him in a desert land, * in a place of horror, and of vast wilderness:<br />
<span class="w">32:14</span>  He led him about, and taught him: * and he kept him as the apple of his eye.<br />
<span class="w">32:15</span>  As the eagle enticing her young to fly, * and hovering over them,<br />
<span class="w">32:16</span>  He spread his wings, and hath taken him * and carried him on his shoulders.<br />
<span class="w">32:17</span>  The Lord alone was his leader: * and there was no strange god with him.<br />
<span class="w">32:18</span>  He set him upon high land: * that he might eat the fruits of the fields,<br />
<span class="w">32:19</span>  That he might suck honey out of the rock, * and oil out of the hardest stone,<br />
<span class="w">32:20</span>  Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep * with the fat of lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan:<br />
<span class="w">32:21</span>  And goats with the marrow of wheat, * and might drink the purest blood of the grape.<br />
<span class="w">32:22</span>  The beloved grew fat, and kicked: * he grew fat, and thick and gross,<br />
<span class="w">32:23</span>  He forsook God who made him, * and departed from God his saviour.<br />
<span class="w">32:24</span>  They provoked him by strange gods, * and stirred him up to anger, with their abominations.<br />
<span class="w">32:25</span>  They sacrificed to devils and not to God: * to gods whom they knew not:<br />
<span class="w">32:26</span>  That were newly come up, * whom their fathers worshipped not.<br />
<span class="w">32:27</span>  Thou hast forsaken the God that beget * and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="w">150:2</span>  Praise ye him for his mighty acts: * praise ye him according to the multitude of his greatness.<br />
<span class="w">150:3</span>  Praise him with sound of trumpet: * praise him with psaltery and harp.<br />
<span class="w">150:4</span>  Praise him with timbrel and choir: * praise him with strings and organs.<br />
<span class="w">150:5</span>  Praise him on high sounding cymbals: praise him on cymbals of joy: * let every spirit praise the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">T</i>he dawn is sprinkling in the east<br />
Its golden shower, as day flows in;<br />
Fast mount the pointed shafts of light:<br />
Farewell to darkness and to sin!<br />
 <br />
Away, ye midnight phantoms all!<br />
Away, despondence and despair!<br />
Whatever guilt the night has brought,<br />
Now let it vanish into air.<br />
 <br />
So, Lord, when that last morning breaks,<br />
Looking to which we sigh and pray,<br />
O may it to thy minstrels prove <br />
The dawning of a better day.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father glory be,<br />
And to his sole-begotten Son;<br />
Glory, O Holy Ghost, to thee,<br />
While everlasting ages run,<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> We are filled in the morning with thy mercy.<br />
