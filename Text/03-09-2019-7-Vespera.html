<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Proper of the season}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">2 Cor 6:1-2</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>rothers, we exhort you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain. For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee; and in the day of salvation have I helped thee.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i> kind Creator, bow thine ear <br />
To mark the cry, to know the tear<br />
Before thy throne of mercy spent <br />
In this thy holy fast of Lent.<br />
 <br />
Our hearts are open, Lord, to thee:<br />
Thou knowest our infirmity;<br />
Pour out on all who seek thy face<br />
Abundance of thy pardoning grace.<br />
 <br />
Our sins are many, this we know; <br />
Spare us, good Lord, thy mercy show;<br />
And for the honour of thy name <br />
Our fainting souls to life reclaim.<br />
 <br />
Give us the self-control that springs<br />
From discipline of outward things,<br />
That fasting inward secretly<br />
The soul may purely dwell with thee.<br />
 <br />
We pray thee, Holy Trinity,<br />
One God, unchanging Unity,<br />
That we from this our abstinence<br />
May reap the fruits of penitence.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> God hath given His Angels charge over thee.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> To keep thee in all thy ways.<br />
