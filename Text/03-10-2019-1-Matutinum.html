<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>he fast, as taught by holy lore, <br />
We keep in solemn course once more:<br />
The fast to all men known, and bound<br />
In forty days of yearly round.<br />
 <br />
The law and seers that were of old<br />
In divers ways this Lent foretold, <br />
Which Christ, all seasons’ King and Guide,<br />
In after ages sanctified.<br />
 <br />
More sparing therefore let us make<br />
The words we speak, the food we take,<br />
Our sleep and mirth, —and closer barred<br />
Be every sense in holy guard.<br />
 <br />
Avoid the evil thoughts that roll<br />
Like waters o’er the heedless soul;<br />
Nor let the foe occasion find<br />
Our souls in slavery to bind.<br />
 <br />
In prayer together let us fall,<br />
And cry for mercy, one and all,<br />
And weep before the Judge’s feet,<br />
And his avenging wrath entreat.<br />
 <br />
Thy grace have we offended sore,<br />
By sins, O God, which we deplore;<br />
But pour upon us from on high,<br />
O pardoning One, thy clemency.<br />
 <br />
Remember thou, though frail we be,<br />
That yet thine handiwork are we;<br />
Nor let the honour of thy name<br />
Be by another put to shame.<br />
 <br />
Forgive the sin that we have wrought;<br />
Increase the good that we have sought:<br />
That we at length, our wanderings o'er,<br />
May please thee here and evermore.<br />
 <br />
Grant O thou Blessed Trinity,<br />
Grant, O Essential Unity,<br />
That this our fast of forty days<br />
May work our profit and thy praise.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">14</span> Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?<br />
<span class="w">15</span> And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?<br />
<span class="w">16</span> And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God; as God saith: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br />
<span class="ri">2 Cor 7:4-9</span><br />
<span class="w">4</span> I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> For also when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we suffered all tribulation; combats without, fears within.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation, wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent; and if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful;<br />
<span class="w">9</span> Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful; but because you were made sorrowful unto penance.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Priests shall pray, with fasting and with weeping, and shall say:<br />
* Spare, O Lord, spare thy people; and give not thine heritage to destruction.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The Priests shall weep between the porch and the altar, and shall say:<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Spare, O Lord, spare thy people; and give not thine heritage to destruction.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Gospel's glorious word Cleansing to our souls afford. Amen. <br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 4:1-11.</span><br />
In that time, Jesus was led by the spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by Pope St. Gregory <span class="w">the Great.</span><br />
<span class="ri">16th on the Gospels</span><br />
Some persons are accustomed to question what Spirit it was of which Jesus was led up into the wilderness, on account of the words a little farther on Then the devil taketh Him up into the holy city and again The devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain. But in truth, and without any searching, we may very fitly take it that we are to believe it was the Holy Ghost Who led Him up into the wilderness; His own Spirit led Him where the evil spirit found Him to tempt Him. When however it is said that He, God and man, was taken up by the devil either into an exceeding high mountain or into the holy city, the mind shrinketh from believing, and the ears of man tingle to hear it. Yet these things we know not to be incredible, when we consider certain other things concerning Him.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> God hath given His Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.<br />
* They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Thou shalt tread upon the adder and the cockatrice, the lion also, and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.<br />
