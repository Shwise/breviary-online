<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>he fast, as taught by holy lore, <br />
We keep in solemn course once more:<br />
The fast to all men known, and bound<br />
In forty days of yearly round.<br />
 <br />
The law and seers that were of old<br />
In divers ways this Lent foretold, <br />
Which Christ, all seasons’ King and Guide,<br />
In after ages sanctified.<br />
 <br />
More sparing therefore let us make<br />
The words we speak, the food we take,<br />
Our sleep and mirth, —and closer barred<br />
Be every sense in holy guard.<br />
 <br />
Avoid the evil thoughts that roll<br />
Like waters o’er the heedless soul;<br />
Nor let the foe occasion find<br />
Our souls in slavery to bind.<br />
 <br />
In prayer together let us fall,<br />
And cry for mercy, one and all,<br />
And weep before the Judge’s feet,<br />
And his avenging wrath entreat.<br />
 <br />
Thy grace have we offended sore,<br />
By sins, O God, which we deplore;<br />
But pour upon us from on high,<br />
O pardoning One, thy clemency.<br />
 <br />
Remember thou, though frail we be,<br />
That yet thine handiwork are we;<br />
Nor let the honour of thy name<br />
Be by another put to shame.<br />
 <br />
Forgive the sin that we have wrought;<br />
Increase the good that we have sought:<br />
That we at length, our wanderings o'er,<br />
May please thee here and evermore.<br />
 <br />
Grant O thou Blessed Trinity,<br />
Grant, O Essential Unity,<br />
That this our fast of forty days<br />
May work our profit and thy praise.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven * upon the children of men.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 13</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  The fool hath said in his heart: * there is no God.<br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: * there is none that doth good, no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:2</span>  The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see if there be any that understand and seek God.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: * there is none that doth good: no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: * the poison of asps is under their lips.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; * their feet are swift to shed blood.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Destruction and unhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: * there is no fear of God before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">13:4</span>  Shall not all they know that work iniquity, * who devour my people as they eat bread?<br />
<span class="w">13:5</span>  They have not called upon the Lord: * there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.<br />
<span class="w">13:6</span>  For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man; * but the Lord is his hope.<br />
<span class="w">13:7</span>  Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? * when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> He who worketh justice * may rest on thy holy mountain, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 14</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">14:1</span>  Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest in thy holy hill?<br />
<span class="w">14:2</span>  He that walketh without blemish, * and worketh justice:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  He that speaketh truth in his heart, * who hath not used deceit in his tongue:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: * nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.<br />
<span class="w">14:4</span>  In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: * but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not; * He that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that doth these things, * shall not be moved for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> He who worketh justice may rest on thy holy mountain, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, incline * thy ear to me, and hear my voice, my Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 16</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">16:1</span>  Hear, O Lord, my justice: * attend to my supplication.<br />
<span class="w">16:1</span>  Give ear unto my prayer, * which proceedeth not from deceitful lips.<br />
<span class="w">16:2</span>  Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: * let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable.<br />
<span class="w">16:3</span>  Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, * thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.<br />
<span class="w">16:4</span>  That my mouth may not speak the works of men: * for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.<br />
<span class="w">16:5</span>  Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: * that my footsteps be not moved.<br />
<span class="w">16:6</span>  I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: * O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.<br />
<span class="w">16:7</span>  Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; * thou who savest them that trust in thee.<br />
<span class="w">16:8</span>  From them that resist thy right hand keep me, * as the apple of thy eye.<br />
<span class="w">16:9</span>  Protect me under the shadow of thy wings. * from the face of the wicked who have afflicted me.<br />
<span class="w">16:10</span>  My enemies have surrounded my soul: They have shut up their fat: * their mouth hath spoken proudly.<br />
<span class="w">16:11</span>  They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: * they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.<br />
<span class="w">16:12</span>  They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; * and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.<br />
<span class="w">16:13</span>  Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; * deliver my soul from the wicked one; thy sword from the enemies of thy hand.<br />
<span class="w">16:14</span>  O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: * their belly is filled from thy hidden stores.<br />
<span class="w">16:14</span>  They are full of children: * and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.<br />
<span class="w">16:15</span>  But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: * I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 17(2-16)</span><em> [4]</em><br />

<span class="w">17:3</span>  My God is my helper, * and in him will I put my trust.<br />
<span class="w">17:3</span>  My protector, and the horn of my salvation, * and my support.<br />
<span class="w">17:4</span>  Praising, I will call upon the Lord: * and I shall be saved from my enemies.<br />
<span class="w">17:5</span>  The sorrows of death surrounded me: * and the torrents of iniquity troubled me.<br />
<span class="w">17:6</span>  The sorrows of hell encompassed me: * and the snares of death prevented me.<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  In my affliction I called upon the Lord, * and I cried to my God:<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  And he heard my voice from his holy temple: * and my cry before him came into his ears.<br />
<span class="w">17:8</span>  The earth shook and trembled: * the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them.<br />
<span class="w">17:9</span>  There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his face: * coals were kindled by it.<br />
<span class="w">17:10</span>  He bowed the heavens, and came down, * and darkness was under his feet.<br />
<span class="w">17:11</span>  And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; * he flew upon the wings of the winds.<br />
<span class="w">17:12</span>  And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him: * dark waters in the clouds of the air.<br />
<span class="w">17:13</span>  At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, * hail and coals of fire.<br />
<span class="w">17:14</span>  And the Lord thundered from heaven, * and the Highest gave his voice: * hail and coals of fire.<br />
<span class="w">17:15</span>  And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: * he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  Then the fountains of waters appeared, * and the foundations of the world were discovered:<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  At thy rebuke, O Lord, * at the blast of the spirit of thy wrath.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">17:19</span>  They prevented me in the day of my affliction: * and the Lord became my protector.<br />
<span class="w">17:20</span>  And he brought me forth into a large place: * he saved me, because he was well pleased with me.<br />
<span class="w">17:21</span>  And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; * and will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:<br />
<span class="w">17:22</span>  Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; * and have not done wickedly against my God.<br />

<span class="w">17:24</span>  And I shall be spotless with him: * and shall keep myself from my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">17:25</span>  And the Lord will reward me according to my justice: * and according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.<br />

<span class="w">17:27</span>  And with the elect thou wilt be elect: * and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted.<br />
<span class="w">17:28</span>  For thou wilt save the humble people; * but wilt bring down the eyes of the proud.<br />
<span class="w">17:29</span>  For thou lightest my lamp, O Lord: * O my God, enlighten my darkness.<br />
<span class="w">17:30</span>  For by thee I shall be delivered from temptation; * and through my God I shall go over a wall.<br />
<span class="w">17:31</span>  As for my God, his way is undefiled: the words of the Lord are fire-tried: * he is the protector of all that trust in him.<br />

<span class="w">29:6</span>  For wrath is in his indignation; * and life in his good will.<br />

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 25:31-46</span><br />
In that time, Jesus said to his disciples: When the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty. And all nations shall be gathered together before him. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo.</span><br />
<span class="ri">On Faith and Works, xv, 4</span><br />
If, without keeping the commandments, it be possible to attain unto life by faith only, <span class="w">and faith, if it hath not works, is dead, James ii. 17,</span> how can it be true that the Lord will say to such as He shall have set on His left hand Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels? He rebuketh them, not because they have not believed in Him, but because they have not wrought good works. Yea, lest any man should promise himself life eternal by faith only, (and faith, if it hath not works, is dead,) the Lord saith that He will gather together all nations, nations who have lived mingled together in the same countries, that we may seem to hear them which have believed indeed in Him, but have not wrought good works, (as though that their dead faith could, being alone, lead them into life eternal,) that we may seem to hear such crying unto Him, Lord, when saw we thee suffering such and such things, and did not minister unto thee?<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation: let us approve ourselves in much patience, in much fasting;<br />
* In the power of God, by the armour of righteousness.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> In all things let us approve ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in much fasting.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> In the power of God, by the armour of righteousness.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

If they shall go into everlasting fire who have not done works of mercy, shall not they go who have taken their neighbour's goods? Or shall not they go who have outraged the temple of God in their own selves, and so been merciless to themselves? As if works of mercy could avail anything without love, contrary to the words of the Apostle Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. <span class="w">1 Cor. xiii. 3.</span> And what manner of love to his neighbour hath he who loveth him as himself and loveth not himself? remembering that he that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul. <span class="w">Ps. x. 6.</span><br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> In all things let us approve ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience;<br />
* That our ministry be not blamed.<br />

Neither dare we say here that by which some delude themselves, namely, that the fire indeed is everlasting, but that they will not burn therein everlastingly. Such men say that they whose faith is dead, will pass through that everlasting fire, and that they are they to whom it is promised that they themselves shall be saved, yet so as by fire. <span class="w">1 Cor. iii. 15.</span> So that, though the fire itself be everlasting, the burning of the damned therein, that is, the work of the fire upon them, will not be everlasting. As though the Lord were answering this beforehand, the last words of His Sermon are And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal. As the fire, so shall the burning be; and the Truth biddeth us know that they shall burn therein, who have lacked, not faith, but good works.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
