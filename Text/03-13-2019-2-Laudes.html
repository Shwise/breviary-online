<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, wash me * yet more from my iniquity.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 50</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.<br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">50:13</span>  Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br />
<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />
<span class="w">50:15</span>  I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.<br />
<span class="w">50:16</span>  Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="w">64:6</span>  Hear us, O God our saviour, * who art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and in the sea afar off.<br />
<span class="w">64:7</span>  Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength, being girded with power: * who troublest the depth of the sea, the noise of its waves.<br />
<span class="w">64:8</span>  The Gentiles shall be troubled, and they that dwell in the uttermost borders shall be afraid at thy signs: * thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to be joyful.<br />
<span class="w">64:10</span>  Thou hast visited the earth, and hast plentifully watered it; * thou hast many ways enriched it.<br />
<span class="w">64:10</span>  The river of God is filled with water, thou hast prepared their food; * for so is its preparation.<br />

<span class="w">100:2</span>  I walked in the innocence of my heart, * in the midst of my house.<br />
<span class="w">100:3</span>  I did not set before my eyes any unjust thing: * I hated the workers of iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">100:4</span>  The perverse heart did not cleave to me: * and the malignant, that turned aside from me, I would not know.<br />
<span class="w">100:5</span>  The man that in private detracted his neighbour, * him did I persecute.<br />
<span class="w">100:5</span>  With him that had a proud eye, and an unsatiable heart, * I would not eat.<br />
<span class="w">100:6</span>  My eyes were upon the faithful of the earth, to sit with me: * the man that walked in the perfect way, he served me.<br />
<span class="w">100:7</span>  He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house: * he that speaketh unjust things did not prosper before my eyes.<br />
<span class="w">100:8</span>  In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land: * that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">2:1</span>  My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, * and my horn is exalted in my God:<br />
<span class="w">2:2</span>  My mouth is enlarged over my enemies: * because I have joyed in thy salvation.<br />
<span class="w">2:3</span>  There is none holy as the Lord is: for there is no other beside thee, * and there is none strong like our God.<br />
<span class="w">2:4</span>  Do not multiply to speak lofty things, * boasting:<br />
<span class="w">2:5</span>  Let old matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all knowledge, * and to him are thoughts prepared.<br />
<span class="w">2:6</span>  The bow of the mighty is overcome, * and the weak are girt with strength.<br />
<span class="w">2:7</span>  They that were full before have hired out themselves for bread: * and the hungry are filled,<br />

<span class="w">145:5</span>  Blessed is he who hath the God of Jacob for his helper, whose hope is in the Lord his God: * who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them.<br />
<span class="w">145:7</span>  Who keepeth truth for ever: who executeth judgment for them that suffer wrong: * who giveth food to the hungry.<br />
<span class="w">145:7</span>  The Lord looseth them that are fettered: * the Lord enlighteneth the blind.<br />
<span class="w">145:8</span>  The Lord lifteth up them that are cast down: * the Lord loveth the just.<br />
<span class="w">145:9</span>  The Lord keepeth the strangers, he will support the fatherless and the widow: * and the ways of sinners he will destroy.<br />
<span class="w">145:10</span>  The Lord shall reign for ever: thy God, O Sion, * unto generation and generation.<br />

<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>

<span class="ri">Isa 58:1</span><br />
<i class="a">C</i>ry, cease not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their wicked doings, and the house of Jacob their sins.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esu, salvation’s Sun Divine, <br />
Within our inmost bosoms shine,<br />
With light all darkness drive away <br />
And give the world a better day.<br />
 <br />
Now days of grace with mercy flow,<br />
O Lord, the gift of tears bestow, <br />
To wash our stains in every part, <br />
Whilst heavenly fire consumes the heart.<br />
 <br />
Rise, crystal tears, from that same source<br />
From whence our sins derive their course;<br />
Nor cease, till hardened hearts relent,<br />
And softened by your streams, repent.<br />
 <br />
Behold, the happy days return, <br />
The days of joy for them that mourn;<br />
May we of their indulgence share, <br />
And bless the God that grants our prayer.<br />
 <br />
May heaven and earth aloud proclaim<br />
The Trinity’s almighty fame;<br />
And we, restored to grace, rejoice<br />
In newness both of heart and voice.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For he hath given his angels charge over thee; <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> To keep thee in all thy ways.<br />
