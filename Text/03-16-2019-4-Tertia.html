Art with the Father and the Son,<br />
It is the hour, our souls possess<br />
With thy full flood of holiness.<br />

Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />

<span class="w">101:2</span>  Hear, O Lord, my prayer: * and let my cry come to thee.<br />
<span class="w">101:3</span>  Turn not away thy face from me: * in the day when I am in trouble, incline thy ear to me.<br />
<span class="w">101:3</span>  In what day soever I shall call upon thee, * hear me speedily.<br />
<span class="w">101:4</span>  For my days are vanished like smoke: * and my bones are grown dry like fuel for the fire.<br />
<span class="w">101:5</span>  I am smitten as grass, and my heart is withered: * because I forgot to eat my bread.<br />
<span class="w">101:6</span>  Through the voice of my groaning, * my bone hath cleaved to my flesh.<br />
<span class="w">101:7</span>  I am become like to a pelican of the wilderness: * I am like a night raven in the house.<br />
<span class="w">101:8</span>  I have watched, * and am become as a sparrow all alone on the housetop.<br />
<span class="w">101:9</span>  All the day long my enemies reproached me: * and they that praised me did swear against me.<br />
<span class="w">101:10</span>  For I did eat ashes like bread, * and mingled my drink with weeping.<br />
<span class="w">101:11</span>  Because of thy anger and indignation: * for having lifted me up thou hast thrown me down.<br />
<span class="w">101:12</span>  My days have declined like a shadow, * and I am withered like grass.<br />
<span class="w">101:13</span>  But thou, O Lord, endurest for ever: * and thy memorial to all generations.<br />

<span class="w">101:14</span>  Thou shalt arise and have mercy on Sion: * for it is time to have mercy on it, for the time is come.<br />
<span class="w">101:15</span>  For the stones thereof have pleased thy servants: * and they shall have pity on the earth thereof.<br />
<span class="w">101:16</span>  And the Gentiles shall fear thy name, O Lord, * and all the kings of the earth thy glory.<br />
<span class="w">101:17</span>  For the Lord hath built up Sion: * and he shall be seen in his glory.<br />
<span class="w">101:18</span>  He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble: * and he hath not despised their petition.<br />
<span class="w">101:19</span>  Let these things be written unto another generation: * and the people that shall be created shall praise the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">101:20</span>  Because he hath looked forth from his high sanctuary: * from heaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth.<br />
<span class="w">101:21</span>  That he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters: * that he might release the children of the slain:<br />
<span class="w">101:22</span>  That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion: * and his praise in Jerusalem;<br />
<span class="w">101:23</span>  When the people assemble together, * and kings, to serve the Lord.<br />

<span class="w">101:25</span>  Call me not away in the midst of my days: * thy years are unto generation and generation.<br />
<span class="w">101:26</span>  In the beginning, O Lord, thou foundedst the earth: * and the heavens are the works of thy hands.<br />
<span class="w">101:27</span>  They shall perish but thou remainest: * and all of them shall grow old like a garment:<br />
<span class="w">101:28</span>  And as a vesture thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed. * But thou art always the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.<br />
<span class="w">101:29</span>  The children of thy servants shall continue: * and their seed shall be directed for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
