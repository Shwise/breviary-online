<span class="w">113:4</span>  The mountains skipped like rams, * and the hills like the lambs of the flock.<br />
<span class="w">113:5</span>  What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: * and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?<br />
<span class="w">113:6</span>  Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, * and ye hills, like lambs of the flock?<br />
<span class="w">113:7</span>  At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, * at the presence of the God of Jacob:<br />
<span class="w">113:8</span>  Who turned the rock into pools of water, * and the stony hill into fountains of waters.<br />
<span class="w">113:9</span>  Not to us, O Lord, not to us; * but to thy name give glory.<br />
<span class="w">113:10</span>  For thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake: * lest the Gentiles should say: Where is their God?<br />
<span class="w">113:11</span>  But our God is in heaven: * he hath done all things whatsoever he would.<br />
<span class="w">113:12</span>  The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, * the works of the hands of men.<br />
<span class="w">113:13</span>  They have mouths and speak not: * they have eyes and see not.<br />
<span class="w">113:14</span>  They have ears and hear not: * they have noses and smell not.<br />
<span class="w">113:15</span>  They have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not: * neither shall they cry out through their throat.<br />
<span class="w">113:16</span>  Let them that make them become like unto them: * and all such as trust in them.<br />
<span class="w">113:17</span>  The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord: * he is their helper and their protector.<br />
<span class="w">113:18</span>  The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord: * he is their helper and their protector.<br />
<span class="w">113:19</span>  They that fear the Lord have hoped in the Lord: * he is their helper and their protector.<br />
<span class="w">113:20</span>  The Lord hath been mindful of us, * and hath blessed us.<br />
<span class="w">113:20</span>  He hath blessed the house of Israel: * he hath blessed the house of Aaron.<br />

<span class="w">113:23</span>  Blessed be you of the Lord, * who made heaven and earth.<br />
<span class="w">113:24</span>  The heaven of heaven is the Lord’s: * but the earth he has given to the children of men.<br />
<span class="w">113:25</span>  The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord: * nor any of them that go down to hell.<br />
<span class="w">113:26</span>  But we that live bless the Lord: * from this time now and for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Proper of the season}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">1 Thess 4:1</span><br />
<i class="a">F</i>or the rest therefore, brethren, we pray and beseech you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us, how you ought to walk, and to please God, so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i> kind Creator, bow thine ear <br />
To mark the cry, to know the tear<br />
Before thy throne of mercy spent <br />
In this thy holy fast of Lent.<br />
 <br />
Our hearts are open, Lord, to thee:<br />
Thou knowest our infirmity;<br />
Pour out on all who seek thy face<br />
Abundance of thy pardoning grace.<br />
 <br />
Our sins are many, this we know; <br />
Spare us, good Lord, thy mercy show;<br />
And for the honour of thy name <br />
Our fainting souls to life reclaim.<br />
 <br />
Give us the self-control that springs<br />
From discipline of outward things,<br />
That fasting inward secretly<br />
The soul may purely dwell with thee.<br />
 <br />
We pray thee, Holy Trinity,<br />
One God, unchanging Unity,<br />
That we from this our abstinence<br />
May reap the fruits of penitence.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For he hath given his angels charge over thee; <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> To keep thee in all thy ways.<br />
