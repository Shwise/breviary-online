<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">J</i>oseph, the praise and glory of the heavens,<br />
Sure pledge of life, and safety of the wide world,<br />
As in our joy we sing to thee, in kindness<br />
List to our praises.<br />
 <br />
Thou by the world's Creator wert appointed<br />
Spouse of the Virgin: thee he willed to honour<br />
Naming thee father of the Word, and guardian<br />
Of our salvation.<br />
 <br />
Thou thy Redeemer, lying in a stable,<br />
Whom long ago foretold the choir of prophets,<br />
Sawest rejoicing, and thy God adoredst<br />
Humble in childhood.<br />
 <br />
God, King of kings, and Governor of the ages,<br />
He at whose word the powers of hell do tremble,<br />
He whom the adoring heavens ever worship<br />
Called the protector.<br />
 <br />
Grant us, great Trinity, for Joseph's holy sake,<br />
In highest bliss and love, above the stars to reign,<br />
That we in joy with him may praise our loving God,<br />
And sing our glad eternal strain.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">3</span> Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper in his hand.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered to him:<br />

From the Sermons of St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux.<br />
<span class="ri">2nd on Luke i. 26.</span><br />
What and what manner of man the blessed Joseph was, we may gather from that title wherewith, albeit only as a deputy, God deemed him fit to be honoured he was both called, and supposed to be the Father of God. We may gather it from his very name, which, being interpreted, signifieth Increase. Remember likewise that great Patriarch who was sold into Egypt, and know that the Husband of Mary not only received his name, but inherited his purity, and was likened to him in innocence and in grace.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

If then, that Joseph that was sold by his brethren through envy, and was brought down to Egypt, was a type of Christ sold by a disciple, and handed over to the Gentiles, the other Joseph flying from the envy of Herod carried Christ into Egypt. That first Joseph kept loyal to his master, and would not carnally know his master's wife; that second Joseph knew that the Lady, the Mother of his Lord, was a virgin, and he himself remained faithfully virgin toward her. To that first Joseph it was given to know dark things in interpreting of dreams; to the second Joseph it was given in sleep to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.<br />

The first Joseph laid by bread, not for himself, but for all people; the second Joseph received into his keeping that Living Bread Which came down from heaven, not for him only, but for the whole world. We cannot doubt but that that Joseph was good and faithful to whom was espoused the Mother of the Saviour. Yea, I say, he was a faithful and wise servant, whom the Lord appointed to be the comfort of His own Mother, the keeper of His own Body, and the only and trusty helper in the Eternal Counsels.<br />

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 1:18-21</span><br />
When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child, of the Holy Ghost. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Jerome, Priest <span class="w">at Bethlehem.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Book of Commentaries, on Matth. i.</span><br />
Why was the Lord conceived of an espoused virgin rather than of a free? First, for the sake of the genealogy of Mary, which we have obtained by that of Joseph. Secondly, because she was thus saved from being stoned by the Jews as an adulteress. Thirdly, that Himself and His mother might have a guardian on their journey into Egypt. To these, Ignatius, the martyr of Antioch, has added a fourth reason namely, that the birth might take place unknown to the devil, who would naturally suppose that Mary had conceived by Joseph.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Mother of Jesus said unto Him Son, why hast Thou thus dealt with us?<br />
* Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And He said unto them: How is it that ye sought Me? Wist ye not that I must be about My Father's business?<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>He whose feast-day we are keeping, be our Advocate with God. Amen. <br />

Before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. She was found, that is, by Joseph, but by no one else. He had already almost an husband's privilege to know all that concerned her. Before they came together. This doth not imply that they ever did come together the Scripture merely showeth the absolute fact that up to this time they had not done so.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Jesus went down with them, and came to Nazareth<br />
* And was subject unto them.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> He increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And was subject unto them.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />

<b>Reading 9</b><br />
Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. If any man be joined to a fornicatress they become one body; and according to the law they that are privy to a crime are thereby guilty. How then can it be that Joseph is described as a just man, at the very time he was compounding the criminality of his espoused? It must have been that he knew her to be pure, and yet understood not the mystery of her pregnancy, but, while he wondered at that which had happened, was willing to hold his peace.<br />
