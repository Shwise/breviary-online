<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>he fast, as taught by holy lore, <br />
We keep in solemn course once more:<br />
The fast to all men known, and bound<br />
In forty days of yearly round.<br />
 <br />
The law and seers that were of old<br />
In divers ways this Lent foretold, <br />
Which Christ, all seasons’ King and Guide,<br />
In after ages sanctified.<br />
 <br />
More sparing therefore let us make<br />
The words we speak, the food we take,<br />
Our sleep and mirth, —and closer barred<br />
Be every sense in holy guard.<br />
 <br />
Avoid the evil thoughts that roll<br />
Like waters o’er the heedless soul;<br />
Nor let the foe occasion find<br />
Our souls in slavery to bind.<br />
 <br />
In prayer together let us fall,<br />
And cry for mercy, one and all,<br />
And weep before the Judge’s feet,<br />
And his avenging wrath entreat.<br />
 <br />
Thy grace have we offended sore,<br />
By sins, O God, which we deplore;<br />
But pour upon us from on high,<br />
O pardoning One, thy clemency.<br />
 <br />
Remember thou, though frail we be,<br />
That yet thine handiwork are we;<br />
Nor let the honour of thy name<br />
Be by another put to shame.<br />
 <br />
Forgive the sin that we have wrought;<br />
Increase the good that we have sought:<br />
That we at length, our wanderings o'er,<br />
May please thee here and evermore.<br />
 <br />
Grant O thou Blessed Trinity,<br />
Grant, O Essential Unity,<br />
That this our fast of forty days<br />
May work our profit and thy praise.<br />
Amen.<br />

Lesson from the book of Genesis<br />
<span class="ri">Gen 37:2-10</span><br />
<span class="w">2</span> And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father's wives and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about, bowed down before my sheaf.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> His brethren answered Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> And when he had told this to his father and brethren, his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And when his brethren saw Joseph afar off, they said one to another: Behold, this dreamer cometh.<br />
* Come, let us slay him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And when his brethren saw that their father loved Joseph more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him; therefore they said:<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Come, let us slay him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

<span class="w">14</span> I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:<br />
<span class="w">15</span> And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> But he answered: I seek my brethren; tell me where they feed the flocks.<br />
<span class="w">17</span> And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they thought to kill him.<br />
<span class="w">19</span> And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh.<br />
<span class="w">20</span> Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit and we will say Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him.<br />
<span class="ri">Gen 37:21-28</span><br />
<span class="w">21</span> And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said:<br />
<span class="w">22</span> Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.<br />
<span class="w">23</span> And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:<br />
<span class="w">24</span> And cast him into an old pit, where there was no water.<br />
<span class="w">25</span> And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Calaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.<br />
<span class="w">26</span> And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?<br />
<span class="w">27</span> It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words.<br />
<span class="w">28</span> And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They drew up Joseph out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver.<br />
* And Reuben returned unto the pit, and when he found not Joseph, he rent his clothes, and wept, and said: The child is not, and I, whither shall I go?<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And they took Joseph's coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid of the goats, and they sent one that brought the coat unto their father, and said: See now whether this be thy son's coat or no.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And Reuben returned unto the pit, and when he found not Joseph, he rent his clothes, and wept. And Reuben said: The child is not, and I, whither shall I go?<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Gospel's glorious word Cleansing to our souls afford. Amen. <br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
From the Holy Gospel according to Luke<br />
<span class="ri">Luke 11:14-28</span><br />
At that time, Jesus was casting out a devil, and the same was dumb: and when he had cast out the devil, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes were in admiration at it. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest <span class="w">at Jarrow.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Bk. iv, 48 on Luke xi</span><br />
We read in Matthew <span class="w">xii. 22</span> that the devil, by which this poor creature was possessed, was not only dumb, but also blind; and that, when he was healed by the Lord, he saw as well as spake. Three miracles, therefore, were performed on this one man; the blind saw, the dumb spake, and the possessed was delivered. This mighty work was then indeed wrought carnally, but it is still wrought spiritually in the conversion of believers, when the devil is cast out of them, so that their eyes see the light of faith, and the lips, that before were dumb, are opened that their mouth may show forth the praise of God. But some of them said: He casteth out devils through Beelzebub, the chief of the devils. These some were not of the multitude, but liars among the Pharisees and Scribes, as we are told by the other Evangelist.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Jacob lamented for his two sons, saying: Woe is me; I am bereaved of Joseph, for he is not; and afflicted because of Benjamin, because he is taken away for bread.<br />
* I pray the King of heaven in my distress, that He may make me to see them yet again.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And Jacob cast him down upon his face upon the ground, and wept sore; and he prayed, saying:<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I pray the King of heaven in my distress, that He may make me to see them yet again.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I pray the King of heaven in my distress, that He may make me to see them yet again.<br />
