<span class="ri">The first verse of the following hymn is said genuflecting.</span><br />
<i class="a">A</i>ve, star of ocean,<br />
Child divine who barest,<br />
Mother, ever-Virgin,<br />
Heaven's portal fairest.<br />

Erst by Gabriel spoken,<br />
Eva's name reversing,<br />
Be of peace the token.<br />

Break the sinners' fetters,<br />
Light to blind restoring,<br />
All our ills dispelling,<br />
Every boon imploring.<br />

Show thyself a mother<br />
In thy supplication;<br />
He will hear who chose thee<br />
At his incarnation.<br />

Passing meek and lowly,<br />
Win for sinners pardon,<br />

And rejoice forever.<br />

Give we equal glory<br />
Equal praise and blessing.<br />
