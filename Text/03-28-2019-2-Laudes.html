<b>Psalms</b> <em>{Laudes:2 Psalms and antiphons  from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Before thee only have I sinned, * O Lord, have mercy on me.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 50</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.<br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">50:13</span>  Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br />
<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />
<span class="w">50:15</span>  I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.<br />
<span class="w">50:16</span>  Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Before thee only have I sinned, O Lord, have mercy on me.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Turn thee again, O Lord, * and be gracious unto thy servants.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 89</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">89:1</span>  Lord, thou hast been our refuge * from generation to generation.<br />
<span class="w">89:2</span>  Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; * from eternity and to eternity thou art God.<br />
<span class="w">89:3</span>  Turn not man away to be brought low: * and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men.<br />
<span class="w">89:4</span>  For a thousand years in thy sight * are as yesterday, which is past.<br />
<span class="w">89:5</span>  And as a watch in the night, * things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.<br />
<span class="w">89:6</span>  In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: * in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither.<br />
<span class="w">89:7</span>  For in thy wrath we have fainted away: * and are troubled in thy indignation.<br />
<span class="w">89:8</span>  Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: * our life in the light of thy countenance.<br />
<span class="w">89:9</span>  For all our days are spent; * and in thy wrath we have fainted away.<br />
<span class="w">89:9</span>  Our years shall be considered as a spider: * the days of our years in them are threescore and ten years.<br />
<span class="w">89:10</span>  But if in the strong they be fourscore years: * and what is more of them is labour and sorrow.<br />
<span class="w">89:10</span>  For mildness is come upon us: * and we shall be corrected.<br />
<span class="w">89:11</span>  Who knoweth the power of thy anger, * and for thy fear can number thy wrath?<br />
<span class="w">89:12</span>  So make thy right hand known: * and men learned in heart, in wisdom.<br />
<span class="w">89:13</span>  Return, O Lord, how long? * and be entreated in favour of thy servants.<br />
<span class="w">89:14</span>  We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: * and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.<br />
<span class="w">89:15</span>  We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: * for the years in which we have seen evils.<br />
<span class="w">89:16</span>  Look upon thy servants and upon their works: * and direct their children.<br />
<span class="w">89:17</span>  And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct thou the works of our hands over us; * yea, the work of our hands do thou direct.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Turn thee again, O Lord, and be gracious unto thy servants.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O God, * thou hast multiplied thy mercy.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 35</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">35:2</span>  The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin: * there is no fear of God before his eyes.<br />
<span class="w">35:3</span>  For in his sight he hath done deceitfully, * that his iniquity may be found unto hatred.<br />
<span class="w">35:4</span>  The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile: * he would not understand that he might do well.<br />
<span class="w">35:5</span>  He hath devised iniquity on his bed, * he hath set himself on every way that is not good: but evil he hath not hated.<br />
<span class="w">35:6</span>  O Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, * and thy truth reacheth even to the clouds.<br />
<span class="w">35:7</span>  Thy justice is as the mountains of God, * thy judgments are a great deep.<br />
<span class="w">35:7</span>  Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord: * O how hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God!<br />
<span class="w">35:8</span>  But the children of men * shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings.<br />
<span class="w">35:9</span>  They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house; * and thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure.<br />
<span class="w">35:10</span>  For with thee is the fountain of life; * and in thy light we shall see light.<br />
<span class="w">35:11</span>  Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, * and thy justice to them that are right in heart.<br />
<span class="w">35:12</span>  Let not the foot of pride come to me, * and let not the hand of the sinner move me.<br />
<span class="w">35:13</span>  There the workers of iniquity are fallen, * they are cast out, and could not stand.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O God, thou hast multiplied thy mercy.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord is my strength * and my praise, and he is become my salvation.<br />
<span class="ri">Canticle of Moses</span><em> [4]</em><br />
 <span class="w">(Canticle of Moses * Exod. 15:1-22)</span> <br />
<span class="w">15:1</span>  Let us sing to the Lord: for he is gloriously magnified, * the horse and the rider he hath thrown into the sea.<br />
<span class="w">15:2</span>  The Lord is my strength and my praise, * and he is become salvation to me:<br />
<span class="w">15:3</span>  He is my God and I will glorify him: * the God of my father, and I will exalt him.<br />
<span class="w">15:4</span>  The Lord is as a man of war, Almighty is his name. * Pharao’s chariots and his army he hath cast into the sea:<br />
<span class="w">15:5</span>  His chosen captains are drowned in the Red Sea. * The depths have covered them, they are sunk to the bottom like a stone.<br />
<span class="w">15:6</span>  Thy right hand, O Lord, is magnified in strength: thy right hand, O Lord, hath slain the enemy. * And in the multitude of thy glory thou hast put down thy adversaries:<br />
<span class="w">15:7</span>  Thou hast sent thy wrath, which hath devoured them like stubble. * And with the blast of thy anger the waters were gathered together:<br />
<span class="w">15:8</span>  The flowing water stood, * the depths were gathered together in the midst of the sea.<br />
<span class="w">15:9</span>  The enemy said: I will pursue and overtake, * I will divide the spoils, my soul shall have its fill:<br />
<span class="w">15:10</span>  I will draw my sword, * my hand shall slay them.<br />
<span class="w">15:11</span>  Thy wind blew and the sea covered them: * they sunk as lead in the mighty waters.<br />
<span class="w">15:12</span>  Who is like to thee, among the strong, O Lord? * who is like to thee, glorious in holiness, terrible and praiseworthy, doing wonders?<br />
<span class="w">15:13</span>  Thou stretchedst forth thy hand, and the earth swallowed them. * In thy mercy thou hast been a leader to the people which thou hast redeemed:<br />
<span class="w">15:14</span>  And in thy strength thou hast carried them * to thy holy habitation.<br />
<span class="w">15:15</span>  Nations rose up, and were angry: * sorrows took hold on the inhabitants of Philisthiim.<br />
<span class="w">15:16</span>  Then were the princes of Edom troubled, trembling seized on the stout men of Moab: * all the inhabitants of Chanaan became stiff.<br />
<span class="w">15:17</span>  Let fear and dread fall upon them, * in the greatness of thy arm:<br />
<span class="w">15:18</span>  Let them become unmoveable as a stone, until thy people, O Lord, pass by: * until this thy people pass by, which thou hast possessed.<br />
<span class="w">15:19</span>  Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, * in thy most firm habitation which thou hast made, O Lord;<br />
<span class="w">15:20</span>  Thy sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have, established. * The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.<br />
<span class="w">15:21</span>  For Pharao went in on horseback with his chariots and horsemen into the sea: * and the Lord brought back upon them the waters of the sea:<br />
<span class="w">15:22</span>  But the children of Israel walked on dry ground * in the midst thereof.<br />

<span class="w">146:10</span>  He shall not delight in the strength of the horse: * nor take pleasure in the legs of a man.<br />
<span class="w">146:11</span>  The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him: * and in them that hope in his mercy.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esu, salvation’s Sun Divine, <br />
Within our inmost bosoms shine,<br />
With light all darkness drive away <br />
And give the world a better day.<br />
 <br />
Now days of grace with mercy flow,<br />
O Lord, the gift of tears bestow, <br />
To wash our stains in every part, <br />
Whilst heavenly fire consumes the heart.<br />
 <br />
Rise, crystal tears, from that same source<br />
From whence our sins derive their course;<br />
Nor cease, till hardened hearts relent,<br />
And softened by your streams, repent.<br />
 <br />
Behold, the happy days return, <br />
The days of joy for them that mourn;<br />
May we of their indulgence share, <br />
And bless the God that grants our prayer.<br />
 <br />
May heaven and earth aloud proclaim<br />
The Trinity’s almighty fame;<br />
And we, restored to grace, rejoice<br />
In newness both of heart and voice.<br />
Amen.<br />
