<span class="w">136:2</span>  On the willows in the midst thereof * we hung up our instruments.<br />

<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Joel 2:17</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>etween the porch and the altar the priests the Lord's ministers shall weep, and shall say: Spare, O Lord, spare thy people: and give not thy inheritance to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i> kind Creator, bow thine ear <br />
To mark the cry, to know the tear<br />
Before thy throne of mercy spent <br />
In this thy holy fast of Lent.<br />
 <br />
Our hearts are open, Lord, to thee:<br />
Thou knowest our infirmity;<br />
Pour out on all who seek thy face<br />
Abundance of thy pardoning grace.<br />
 <br />
Our sins are many, this we know; <br />
Spare us, good Lord, thy mercy show;<br />
And for the honour of thy name <br />
Our fainting souls to life reclaim.<br />
 <br />
Give us the self-control that springs<br />
From discipline of outward things,<br />
That fasting inward secretly<br />
The soul may purely dwell with thee.<br />
 <br />
We pray thee, Holy Trinity,<br />
One God, unchanging Unity,<br />
That we from this our abstinence<br />
May reap the fruits of penitence.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For he hath given his angels charge over thee; <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> To keep thee in all thy ways.<br />
