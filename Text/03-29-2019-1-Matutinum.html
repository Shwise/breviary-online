<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>he fast, as taught by holy lore, <br />
We keep in solemn course once more:<br />
The fast to all men known, and bound<br />
In forty days of yearly round.<br />
 <br />
The law and seers that were of old<br />
In divers ways this Lent foretold, <br />
Which Christ, all seasons’ King and Guide,<br />
In after ages sanctified.<br />
 <br />
More sparing therefore let us make<br />
The words we speak, the food we take,<br />
Our sleep and mirth, —and closer barred<br />
Be every sense in holy guard.<br />
 <br />
Avoid the evil thoughts that roll<br />
Like waters o’er the heedless soul;<br />
Nor let the foe occasion find<br />
Our souls in slavery to bind.<br />
 <br />
In prayer together let us fall,<br />
And cry for mercy, one and all,<br />
And weep before the Judge’s feet,<br />
And his avenging wrath entreat.<br />
 <br />
Thy grace have we offended sore,<br />
By sins, O God, which we deplore;<br />
But pour upon us from on high,<br />
O pardoning One, thy clemency.<br />
 <br />
Remember thou, though frail we be,<br />
That yet thine handiwork are we;<br />
Nor let the honour of thy name<br />
Be by another put to shame.<br />
 <br />
Forgive the sin that we have wrought;<br />
Increase the good that we have sought:<br />
That we at length, our wanderings o'er,<br />
May please thee here and evermore.<br />
 <br />
Grant O thou Blessed Trinity,<br />
Grant, O Essential Unity,<br />
That this our fast of forty days<br />
May work our profit and thy praise.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord set up a testimony in Jacob: * and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(1-8)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:1</span>  Attend, O my people, to my law: * incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">77:2</span>  I will open my mouth in parables: * I will utter propositions from the beginning.<br />
<span class="w">77:3</span>  How great things have we heard and known, * and our fathers have told us.<br />
<span class="w">77:4</span>  They have not been hidden from their children, * in another generation.<br />
<span class="w">77:4</span>  Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, * and his wonders which he hath done.<br />
<span class="w">77:5</span>  And he set up a testimony in Jacob: * and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="w">77:5</span>  How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: * that another generation might know them.<br />
<span class="w">77:6</span>  The children that should be born and should rise up, * and declare them to their children.<br />
<span class="w">77:7</span>  That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: * and may seek his commandments.<br />
<span class="w">77:8</span>  That they may not become like their fathers, * a perverse and exasperating generation.<br />
<span class="w">77:8</span>  A generation that set not their heart aright: * and whose spirit was not faithful to God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord did wonderful things * in the sight of their fathers.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(9-16)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:9</span>  The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: * they have turned back in the day of battle.<br />
<span class="w">77:10</span>  They kept not the covenant of God: * and in his law they would not walk.<br />
<span class="w">77:11</span>  And they forgot his benefits, * and his wonders that he had shewn them.<br />
<span class="w">77:12</span>  Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, * in the field of Tanis.<br />
<span class="w">77:13</span>  He divided the sea and brought them through: * and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.<br />
<span class="w">77:14</span>  And he conducted them with a cloud by day: * and all the night with a light of fire.<br />
<span class="w">77:15</span>  He struck the rock in the wilderness: * and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.<br />
<span class="w">77:16</span>  He brought forth water out of the rock: * and made streams run down as rivers.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord did wonderful things in the sight of their fathers.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord opened * the doors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(17-31)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:17</span>  And they added yet more sin against him: * they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.<br />
<span class="w">77:18</span>  And they tempted God in their hearts, * by asking meat for their desires.<br />
<span class="w">77:19</span>  And they spoke ill of God: * they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?<br />
<span class="w">77:20</span>  Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, * and the streams overflowed.<br />
<span class="w">77:20</span>  Can he also give bread, * or provide a table for his people?<br />
<span class="w">77:21</span>  Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: * and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.<br />
<span class="w">77:22</span>  Because they believed not in God: * and trusted not in his salvation.<br />
<span class="w">77:23</span>  And he had commanded the clouds from above, * and had opened the doors of heaven.<br />
<span class="w">77:24</span>  And had rained down manna upon them to eat, * and had given them the bread of heaven.<br />
<span class="w">77:25</span>  Man ate the bread of angels: * he sent them provisions in abundance.<br />
<span class="w">77:26</span>  He removed the south wind from heaven: * and by his power brought in the southwest wind.<br />
<span class="w">77:27</span>  And he rained upon them flesh as dust: * and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.<br />
<span class="w">77:28</span>  And they fell in the midst of their camp, * round about their pavilions.<br />
<span class="w">77:29</span>  So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: * they were not defrauded of that which they craved.<br />
<span class="w">77:30</span>  As yet their meat was in their mouth: * and the wrath of God came upon them.<br />
<span class="w">77:31</span>  And he slew the fat ones amongst them, * and brought down the chosen men of Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord opened the doors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> God is their helper, * and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(32-41)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:32</span>  In all these things they sinned still: * and they believed not for his wondrous works.<br />
<span class="w">77:33</span>  And their days were consumed in vanity, * and their years in haste.<br />
<span class="w">77:34</span>  When he slew them, then they sought him: * and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.<br />
<span class="w">77:35</span>  And they remembered that God was their helper: * and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="w">77:36</span>  And they loved him with their mouth: * and with their tongue they lied unto him:<br />
<span class="w">77:37</span>  But their heart was not right with him: * nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.<br />
<span class="w">77:38</span>  But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: * and will not destroy them.<br />
<span class="w">77:38</span>  And many a time did he turn away his anger: * and did not kindle all his wrath.<br />
<span class="w">77:39</span>  And he remembered that they are flesh: * a wind that goeth and returneth not.<br />
<span class="w">77:40</span>  How often did they provoke him in the desert: * and move him to wrath in the place without water?<br />
<span class="w">77:41</span>  And they turned back and tempted God: * and grieved the holy one of Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> God is their helper, and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord redeemed them * from the hand of him that afflicted them.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(42-58)</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:42</span>  They remembered not his hand, * in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:<br />
<span class="w">77:43</span>  How he wrought his signs in Egypt, * and his wonders in the field of Tanis.<br />
<span class="w">77:44</span>  And he turned their rivers into blood, * and their showers that they might, not drink.<br />
<span class="w">77:45</span>  He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them: * and frogs which destroyed them.<br />
<span class="w">77:46</span>  And he gave up their fruits to the blast, * and their labours to the locust.<br />
<span class="w">77:47</span>  And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, * and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.<br />
<span class="w">77:48</span>  And he gave up their cattle to the hail, * and their stock to the fire.<br />
<span class="w">77:49</span>  And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: * indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.<br />
<span class="w">77:50</span>  He made a way for a path to his anger: * he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.<br />
<span class="w">77:51</span>  And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: * the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.<br />
<span class="w">77:52</span>  And he took away his own people as sheep: * and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br />
<span class="w">77:53</span>  And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: * and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br />
<span class="w">77:54</span>  And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: * the mountain which his right hand had purchased.<br />
<span class="w">77:54</span>  And he cast out the Gentiles before them: * and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.<br />
<span class="w">77:55</span>  And he made the tribes of Israel * to dwell in their tabernacles.<br />
<span class="w">77:56</span>  Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: * and they kept not his testimonies.<br />
<span class="w">77:57</span>  And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: * even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.<br />
<span class="w">77:58</span>  They provoked him to anger on their hills: * and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 77(59-72)</span><em> [6]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:59</span>  God heard, and despised them, * and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.<br />
<span class="w">77:60</span>  And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, * his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.<br />
<span class="w">77:61</span>  And he delivered their strength into captivity: * and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.<br />
<span class="w">77:62</span>  And he shut up his people under the sword: * and he despised his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">77:63</span>  Fire consumed their young men: * and their maidens were not lamented.<br />
<span class="w">77:64</span>  Their priests fell by the sword: * and their widows did not mourn.<br />
<span class="w">77:65</span>  And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, * and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.<br />
<span class="w">77:66</span>  And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: * he put them to an everlasting reproach.<br />
<span class="w">77:67</span>  And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: * and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:<br />
<span class="w">77:68</span>  But he chose the tribe of Juda, * mount Sion which he loved.<br />
<span class="w">77:69</span>  And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land * which he founded for ever.<br />
<span class="w">77:70</span>  And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: * he brought him from following the ewes great with young,<br />
<span class="w">77:71</span>  To feed Jacob his servant, * and Israel his inheritance.<br />

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 4:5-42</span><br />
At that time, Jesus cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo.</span><br />
<span class="ri">15th Tract on John</span><br />
Jesus, wearied with His journey, the mysteries are beginning now. It is not for nothing that Jesus is wearied. It is not for nothing that the Mighty One of God is wearied. It is not for nothing that He is wearied Who Himself giveth Rest to all them that are weary and heavy-laden. It is not for nothing that He is wearied Whose absence prostrateth us, and Whose presence maketh us to be strong.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> When Jacob saw Joseph's coat he rent his clothes, and mourned; and he said:<br />
* An evil beast hath devoured my son Joseph.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And his brethren took his coat, and sent it to his father and he knew it, and said:<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> An evil beast hath devoured my son Joseph.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

Jesus, therefore, being wearied with His journey, sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour. There is a depth in all these details they all have something to say for us to learn. Upon them we gaze. Knock, saith the Lord, and it shall be opened unto you. Let us knock then and, O, may He open to me and to you, even He Who hath spoken to us those words Knock, and it shall be opened unto you. <span class="w">Matth. vii. 7.</span> It is for thy sake that Jesus was wearied with His journey. We find the strength of Jesus, and we find Jesus weak; yea, strong and weak. Strong, for In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God the Same was in the beginning with God. Wouldest thou know again how that the Son of God is strong? All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made made without effort. <span class="w">John i. 1-3.</span> What then is stronger than He by Whom all things were made without effort? Wouldest thou know His weakness? The Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us. Christ, strong, made thee; Christ, weak, redeemed thee. Christ, strong, made all things out of nothing; Christ, weak, so wrought that that was made perished not. His strength hath made us, and His weakness saved us.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> When Joseph came into the land of Egypt, he heard a language that he understood not; his hands were burdened with labour;<br />
* And his tongue spake wisdom among princes.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Whose feet they hurt with fetters; the iron entered into his soul, until the time that his word came<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And his tongue spake wisdom among princes.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

He then, being Himself made weak, is strength to all such as are weak, gathering them together, to use His own figure, even as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! <span class="w">Matth. xxiii. 37.</span> Consider now, my brethren, in what bondage is an hen to her chickens. There is no other bird in whom motherhood is unmistakeable. We watch the sparrows building their nests under our eyes; we see swallows, and storks, and pigeons building theirs every day. But, unless we actually see them in their nests, we know not if they have little ones, or no. But the hen's motherhood is so much a part of herself, that even if at the minute we see not her children the chickens following after her, nevertheless we see by her ways if she be a mother.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Think on me when it shall be well with thee;<br />
* And make mention of me unto Pharaoh, that he may bring me out of this prison. * For I was stolen away; and here have I done nothing, that they should put me into the dungeon.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For yet three days, and then Pharaoh shall remember thy service, and restore thee unto thy place; then think of me.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And make mention of me unto Pharaoh, that he may bring me out of this prison.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For I was stolen away; and here have I done nothing, that they should put me into the dungeon.<br />
