<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Then shalt Thou be pleased * with the sacrifices of righteousness, when Thou hast hidden thy face from my sins.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 50</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.<br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">50:13</span>  Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br />
<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />
<span class="w">50:15</span>  I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.<br />
<span class="w">50:16</span>  Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 117</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">117:1</span>  Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: * for his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
<span class="w">117:2</span>  Let Israel now say, that he is good: * that his mercy endureth for ever.<br />

<span class="w">117:4</span>  Let them that fear the Lord now say, * that his mercy endureth for ever.<br />
<span class="w">117:5</span>  In my trouble I called upon the Lord: * and the Lord heard me, and enlarged me.<br />
<span class="w">117:6</span>  The Lord is my helper: * I will not fear what man can do unto me.<br />
<span class="w">117:7</span>  The Lord is my helper: * and I will look over my enemies.<br />
<span class="w">117:8</span>  It is good to confide in the Lord, * rather than to have confidence in man.<br />

<span class="w">117:10</span>  All nations compassed me about; * and in the name of the Lord I have been revenged on them.<br />
<span class="w">117:11</span>  Surrounding me they compassed me about: * and in the name of the Lord I have been revenged on them.<br />
<span class="w">117:12</span>  They surrounded me like bees, and they burned like fire among thorns: * and in the name of the Lord I was revenged on them.<br />

<span class="w">117:14</span>  The Lord is my strength and my praise: * and he is become my salvation.<br />
<span class="w">117:15</span>  The voice of rejoicing and of salvation * is in the tabernacles of the just.<br />
<span class="w">117:16</span>  The right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength: the right hand of the Lord hath exalted me: * the right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength.<br />
<span class="w">117:17</span>  I shall not die, but live: * and shall declare the works of the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">117:18</span>  The Lord chastising hath chastised me: * but he hath not delivered me over to death.<br />
<span class="w">117:19</span>  Open ye to me the gates of justice: I will go in to them, and give praise to the Lord. * This is the gate of the Lord, the just shall enter into it.<br />
<span class="w">117:21</span>  I will give glory to thee because thou hast heard me: * and art become my salvation.<br />
<span class="w">117:22</span>  The stone which the builders rejected; * the same is become the head of the corner.<br />
<span class="w">117:23</span>  This is the Lordâ€™s doing: * and it is wonderful in our eyes.<br />
<span class="w">117:24</span>  This is the day which the Lord hath made: * let us be glad and rejoice therein.<br />

<span class="w">117:26</span>  We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord: * The Lord is God, and he hath shone upon us.<br />
<span class="w">117:27</span>  Appoint a solemn day, with shady boughs, * even to the horn of the altar.<br />
<span class="w">117:28</span>  Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: * thou art my God, and I will exalt thee.<br />
<span class="w">117:28</span>  I will praise thee, because thou hast heard me, * and art become my salvation.<br />

<span class="w">62:2</span>  O God, my God, * to thee do I watch at break of day.<br />
<span class="w">62:2</span>  For thee my soul hath thirsted; * for thee my flesh, O how many ways!<br />
<span class="w">62:3</span>  In a desert land, and where there is no way, and no water: * so in the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory.<br />
<span class="w">62:4</span>  For thy mercy is better than lives: * thee my lips shall praise.<br />
<span class="w">62:5</span>  Thus will I bless thee all my life long: * and in thy name I will lift up my hands.<br />
<span class="w">62:6</span>  Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness: * and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.<br />
<span class="w">62:7</span>  If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in the morning: * because thou hast been my helper.<br />
<span class="w">62:8</span>  And I will rejoice under the covert of thy wings: my soul hath stuck close to thee: * thy right hand hath received me.<br />
<span class="w">62:10</span>  But they have sought my soul in vain, they shall go into the lower parts of the earth: * they shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the portions of foxes.<br />
<span class="w">62:12</span>  But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be praised that swear by him: * because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things.<br />

<i class="a">B</i>rothers: For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman. But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise, which things are said by an allegory. <br />

<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esu, salvationâ€™s Sun Divine, <br />
Within our inmost bosoms shine,<br />
With light all darkness drive away <br />
And give the world a better day.<br />
 <br />
Now days of grace with mercy flow,<br />
O Lord, the gift of tears bestow, <br />
To wash our stains in every part, <br />
Whilst heavenly fire consumes the heart.<br />
 <br />
Rise, crystal tears, from that same source<br />
From whence our sins derive their course;<br />
Nor cease, till hardened hearts relent,<br />
And softened by your streams, repent.<br />
 <br />
Behold, the happy days return, <br />
The days of joy for them that mourn;<br />
May we of their indulgence share, <br />
And bless the God that grants our prayer.<br />
 <br />
May heaven and earth aloud proclaim<br />
The Trinityâ€™s almighty fame;<br />
And we, restored to grace, rejoice<br />
In newness both of heart and voice.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For he hath given his angels charge over thee; <br />
