<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Have mercy on me, * O God, according to thy great mercy.<span class="w"> ‡</span><br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 50</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy. <br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  <span class="w">‡</span> And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">50:13</span>  Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br />
<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />
<span class="w">50:15</span>  I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.<br />
<span class="w">50:16</span>  Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="w">5:4</span>  For to thee will I pray: * O Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my voice.<br />
<span class="w">5:5</span>  In the morning I will stand before thee, and will see: * because thou art not a God that willest iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">5:6</span>  Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee: * nor shall the unjust abide before thy eyes.<br />
<span class="w">5:7</span>  Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity: * thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie.<br />
<span class="w">5:7</span>  The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor. * But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy,<br />
<span class="w">5:8</span>  I will come into thy house; * I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear.<br />
<span class="w">5:9</span>  Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice: * because of my enemies, direct my way in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">5:10</span>  For there is no truth in their mouth: * their heart is vain.<br />
<span class="w">5:11</span>  Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully with their tongues: * judge them, O God.<br />
<span class="w">5:11</span>  Let them fall from their devices: according to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out: * for they have provoked thee, O Lord.<br />
<span class="w">5:12</span>  But let all them be glad that hope in thee: * they shall rejoice for ever, and thou shalt dwell in them.<br />
<span class="w">5:12</span>  And all they that love thy name shall glory in thee: * For thou wilt bless the just.<br />

<span class="w">28:7</span>  The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire: * The voice of the Lord shaketh the desert: and the Lord shall shake the desert of Cades.<br />
<span class="w">28:9</span>  The voice of the Lord prepareth the stags: and he will discover the thick woods: * and in his temple all shall speak his glory.<br />
<span class="w">28:10</span>  The Lord maketh the flood to dwell: * and the Lord shall sit king for ever.<br />

<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Isa 58:1</span><br />
<i class="a">C</i>ry, cease not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their wicked doings, and the house of Jacob their sins.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esu, salvation’s Sun Divine, <br />
Within our inmost bosoms shine,<br />
With light all darkness drive away <br />
And give the world a better day.<br />
 <br />
Now days of grace with mercy flow,<br />
O Lord, the gift of tears bestow, <br />
To wash our stains in every part, <br />
Whilst heavenly fire consumes the heart.<br />
 <br />
Rise, crystal tears, from that same source<br />
From whence our sins derive their course;<br />
Nor cease, till hardened hearts relent,<br />
And softened by your streams, repent.<br />
 <br />
Behold, the happy days return, <br />
The days of joy for them that mourn;<br />
May we of their indulgence share, <br />
And bless the God that grants our prayer.<br />
 <br />
May heaven and earth aloud proclaim<br />
The Trinity’s almighty fame;<br />
And we, restored to grace, rejoice<br />
In newness both of heart and voice.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For he hath given his angels charge over thee; <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> To keep thee in all thy ways.<br />

<span class="w">1:78</span> Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, * in which the Orient from on high hath visited us:<br />
