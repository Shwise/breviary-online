<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>ing, my tongue, the glorious battle<br />
Sing the last, the dread affray;<br />
O'er the cross, the victor's trophy,<br />
Sound the high triumphal lay:<br />
Tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer,<br />
As a victim won the day.<br />
 <br />
God, his Maker, sorely grieving<br />
That the first-made Adam fell,<br />
When he ate the fruit of sorrow,<br />
Whose reward was death and hell,<br />
Noted then this wood, the ruin<br />
Of the ancient wood to quell.<br />
 <br />
For the work of our salvation<br />
Needs would have his order so,<br />
And the multiform deceiver's<br />
Art by art would overthrow,<br />
And from thence would bring the med'cine<br />
Whence the insult of the foe.<br />
 <br />
Wherefore, when the sacred fullness<br />
Of the appointed time was come, <br />
This world's Maker left his Father,<br />
Sent the heav'nly mansion from, <br />
And proceeded, God Incarnate, <br />
Of the Virgin's holy womb.<br />
 <br />
Weeps the infant in the manger<br />
That in Bethlehem's stable stands;<br />
And his limbs the Virgin Mother<br />
Doth compose in swaddling bands,<br />
Meetly thus in linen folding<br />
Of her God the feet and hands.<br />
 <br />
To the Trinity be glory<br />
Everlasting, as is meet;<br />
Equal to the Father, equal<br />
To the Son, and Paraclete:<br />
Trinal Unity, whose praises<br />
All created things repeat.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">1:5</span>  Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: * nor sinners in the council of the just.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 2</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">2:1</span>  Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?<br />

<span class="w">3:4</span>  But thou, O Lord art my protector, * my glory, and the lifter up of my head.<br />
<span class="w">3:5</span>  I have cried to the Lord with my voice: * and he hath heard me from his holy hill.<br />

<span class="w">15</span> For behold I will call together all the families of the kingdoms of the north: saith the Lord: and they shall come, and shall set every one his throne in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all the walls thereof round about, and upon all the cities of Juda,<br />
<span class="w">16</span> And I will pronounce my judgements against them, touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, and have adored the work of their own hands.<br />
<span class="w">17</span> Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee. Be not afraid at their presence for I will make thee not to fear their countenance.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> For behold I have made thee this day a fortified city, and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Juda, to the princes thereof, and to the priests, and to the people of the land.<br />
<span class="w">19</span> And they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail: for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
From the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 8:46-59</span><br />
At that time, Jesus said to the multitude of Jews: Which of you shall convince me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me? And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by Pope St. Gregory (the Great)<br />
<span class="ri">18th on the Gospels</span><br />
Dearly beloved brethren, consider the gentleness of God. He came to take away sins, and He saith Which of you convinceth Me of sin? He Who, through the might of His Godhead, was able to justify sinners, was contented to show by argument that He was not Himself a sinner. But exceeding dread is that which followeth. He that is of God heareth God's words; ye, therefore, hear them not, because ye are not of God. If, then, whosoever is of God heareth God's words, and whosoever is not of Him cannot hear His words, let each one ask himself if he, in the ear of his heart, heareth God's words, and understandeth Whose words they are? The Truth commandeth us to long for a Fatherland in heaven, to bridle the lusts of the flesh, to turn away from the glory of the world, to seek no man's goods, and to give away our own.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night! for my nearest brother hath supplanted me,<br />
* And my neighbour hath walked with slanders against me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the Angel of the Lord persecute them.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And my neighbour hath walked with slanders against me.<br />
<span class="w">omit Glory be</span><br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night! for my nearest brother hath supplanted me, and my neighbour hath walked with slanders against me.<br />
