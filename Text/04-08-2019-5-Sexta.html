<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> God of truth, O Lord of might,<br />
Who orderest time and change aright,<br />
Who send’st the early morning ray,<br />
And light’st the glow of perfect day:<br />
 <br />
Extinguish thou each sinful fire,<br />
And banish every ill desire;<br />
And while thou keep’st the body whole,<br />
Shed forth thy peace upon the soul.<br />
 <br />
* Almighty Father, hear our cry,<br />
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />
<b>Psalms</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O my people, * what have I done to thee, or in what have I grieved thee? Testify against me.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 30(2-9)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">30:2</span>  In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: * deliver me in thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">30:3</span>  Bow down thy ear to me: * make haste to deliver me.<br />
<span class="w">30:3</span>  Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, * to save me.<br />
<span class="w">30:4</span>  For thou art my strength and my refuge; * and for thy name’s sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.<br />
<span class="w">30:5</span>  Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: * for thou art my protector.<br />
<span class="w">30:6</span>  Into thy hands I commend my spirit: * thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.<br />
<span class="w">30:7</span>  Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, * to no purpose.<br />
<span class="w">30:7</span>  But I have hoped in the Lord: * I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy.<br />
<span class="w">30:8</span>  For thou hast regarded my humility, * thou hast saved my soul out of distresses.<br />
<span class="w">30:9</span>  And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: * thou hast set my feet in a spacious place.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 30(10-19)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">30:10</span>  Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: * my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly:<br />
<span class="w">30:11</span>  For my life is wasted with grief: * and my years in sighs.<br />
<span class="w">30:11</span>  My strength is weakened through poverty * and my bones are disturbed.<br />
<span class="w">30:12</span>  I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my neighbours; * and a fear to my acquaintance.<br />
<span class="w">30:12</span>  They that saw me without fled from me. * I am forgotten as one dead from the heart.<br />
<span class="w">30:13</span>  I am become as a vessel that is destroyed. * For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about.<br />
<span class="w">30:14</span>  While they assembled together against me, * they consulted to take away my life.<br />
<span class="w">30:15</span>  But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: * I said: Thou art my God. My lots are in thy hands.<br />
<span class="w">30:16</span>  Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; * and from them that persecute me<br />
<span class="w">30:17</span>  Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy. * Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee.<br />
<span class="w">30:18</span>  Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell. * Let deceitful lips be made dumb.<br />
<span class="w">30:19</span>  Which speak iniquity against the just, * with pride and abuse.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 30(20-25)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">30:20</span>  How great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, * which thou hast hidden for them that fear thee!<br />
<span class="w">30:20</span>  Which thou hast wrought for them that hope in thee, * in the sight of the sons of men.<br />
<span class="w">30:21</span>  Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, * from the disturbance of men.<br />
<span class="w">30:21</span>  Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle * from the contradiction of tongues.<br />
<span class="w">30:22</span>  Blessed be the Lord, * for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me in a fortified city.<br />
<span class="w">30:23</span>  But I said in the excess of my mind: * I am cast away from before thy eyes.<br />
<span class="w">30:23</span>  Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, * when I cried to thee.<br />
<span class="w">30:24</span>  O love the Lord, all ye his saints: * for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.<br />
<span class="w">30:25</span>  Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, * all ye that hope in the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O my people, what have I done to thee, or in what have I grieved thee? Testify against me.<br />
