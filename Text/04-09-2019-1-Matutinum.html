<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>ing, my tongue, the glorious battle<br />
Sing the last, the dread affray;<br />
O'er the cross, the victor's trophy,<br />
Sound the high triumphal lay:<br />
Tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer,<br />
As a victim won the day.<br />
 <br />
God, his Maker, sorely grieving<br />
That the first-made Adam fell,<br />
When he ate the fruit of sorrow,<br />
Whose reward was death and hell,<br />
Noted then this wood, the ruin<br />
Of the ancient wood to quell.<br />
 <br />
For the work of our salvation<br />
Needs would have his order so,<br />
And the multiform deceiver's<br />
Art by art would overthrow,<br />
And from thence would bring the med'cine<br />
Whence the insult of the foe.<br />
 <br />
Wherefore, when the sacred fullness<br />
Of the appointed time was come, <br />
This world's Maker left his Father,<br />
Sent the heav'nly mansion from, <br />
And proceeded, God Incarnate, <br />
Of the Virgin's holy womb.<br />
 <br />
Weeps the infant in the manger<br />
That in Bethlehem's stable stands;<br />
And his limbs the Virgin Mother<br />
Doth compose in swaddling bands,<br />
Meetly thus in linen folding<br />
Of her God the feet and hands.<br />
 <br />
To the Trinity be glory<br />
Everlasting, as is meet;<br />
Equal to the Father, equal<br />
To the Son, and Paraclete:<br />
Trinal Unity, whose praises<br />
All created things repeat.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">34:2</span>  Take hold of arms and shield: * and rise up to help me.<br />

<span class="w">34:4</span>  Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek after my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:4</span>  Let them be turned back and be confounded * that devise against me.<br />

<span class="w">34:6</span>  Let their way become dark and slippery; * and let the Angel of the Lord pursue them.<br />
<span class="w">34:7</span>  For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: * without cause they have upbraided my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:8</span>  Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: * and into that very snare let them fall.<br />
<span class="w">34:9</span>  But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; * and shall be delighted in his salvation.<br />
<span class="w">34:10</span>  All my bones shall say: * Lord, who is like to thee?<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 34(11-17)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">34:11</span>  Unjust witnesses rising up * have asked me things I knew not.<br />
<span class="w">34:12</span>  They repaid me evil for good: * to the depriving me of my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:13</span>  But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, * I was clothed with haircloth.<br />

<span class="w">34:14</span>  As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: * as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.<br />

<span class="w">34:16</span>  They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: * they gnashed upon me with their teeth.<br />

<span class="w">34:19</span>  Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: * who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">34:20</span>  For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; * and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.<br />
<span class="w">34:21</span>  And they opened their mouth wide against me; * they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.<br />
<span class="w">34:22</span>  Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: * O Lord, depart not from me.<br />
<span class="w">34:23</span>  Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: * to my cause, my God, and my Lord.<br />
<span class="w">34:24</span>  Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, * and let them not rejoice over me.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Envy not * the man who prospereth in his way; the man who doth unjust things.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 36(1-15)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:1</span>  Be not emulous of evildoers; * nor envy them that work iniquity.<br />

<span class="w">36:5</span>  Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, * and he will do it.<br />
<span class="w">36:6</span>  And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday: * be subject to the Lord and pray to him.<br />
<span class="w">36:7</span>  Envy not the man who prospereth in his way; * the man who doth unjust things.<br />
<span class="w">36:8</span>  Cease from anger, and leave rage; * have no emulation to do evil.<br />
<span class="w">36:9</span>  For the evildoers shall be cut off: * but they that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the land.<br />
<span class="w">36:10</span>  For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: * and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.<br />
<span class="w">36:11</span>  But the meek shall inherit the land, * and shall delight in abundance of peace.<br />
<span class="w">36:12</span>  The sinner shall watch the just man: * and shall gnash upon him with his teeth.<br />

<span class="w">36:19</span>  They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled, * because the wicked shall perish.<br />
<span class="w">36:20</span>  And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, * shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke.<br />
<span class="w">36:21</span>  The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; * but the just sheweth mercy and shall give.<br />
<span class="w">36:22</span>  For such as bless him shall inherit the land: * but such as curse him shall perish.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Keep innocence * and behold justice.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 36(30-40)</span><em> [6]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:30</span>  The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom: * and his tongue shall speak judgment.<br />
<span class="w">36:31</span>  The law of his God is in his heart, * and his steps shall not be supplanted.<br />
<span class="w">36:32</span>  The wicked watcheth the just man, * and seeketh to put him to death.<br />
<span class="w">36:33</span>  But the Lord will not leave him in his hands; * nor condemn him when he shall be judged.<br />
<span class="w">36:34</span>  Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: * when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.<br />
<span class="w">36:35</span>  I have seen the wicked highly exalted, * and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus.<br />
<span class="w">36:36</span>  And I passed by, and lo, he was not: * and I sought him and his place was not found.<br />
<span class="w">36:37</span>  Keep innocence, and behold justice: * for there are remnants for the peaceable man.<br />
<span class="w">36:38</span>  But the unjust shall be destroyed together: * the remnants of the wicked shall perish.<br />
<span class="w">36:39</span>  But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, * and he is their protector in the time of trouble.<br />
<span class="w">36:40</span>  And the Lord will help them and deliver them: * and he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them, because they have hoped in him.<br />

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 7:1-13</span><br />
At that time: Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo.</span><br />
<span class="ri">28th Tract on John</span><br />
In this chapter of the Gospel, my brethren, our Lord Jesus Christ hath much commended Himself unto our faith, as touching His Manhood. At the same time, His words and works were alway such as to give us to believe that He is both God and Man, yea, that God Who made us, and that Man Who hath sought us, yea, God the Son, Who, as touching His Godhead, is alway with the Father, <span class="w">John i. 18; iii. 13,</span> and, as touching His Manhood, hath been with us in time. <span class="w">Matth. i. 23.</span> For He had not sought the work of His hands unless He had been made His own work. <span class="w">John i. 14.</span> Keep this well in mind, and let your hearts never forget it, namely, that Christ was not made Man so as to cease to be God. He, Who made the Manhood, took It into that Godhead Which is His from everlasting to everlasting.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thou art my Helper and my Protector, O Lord, and in thy word do I hope.<br />
* Depart from me, ye evil doers, for I will keep the commandments of my God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> I hate the unrighteous, but thy law do I love.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Depart from me, ye evil doers, for I will keep the commandments of my God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

While therefore He lay hid in the Manhood, we must not think that He had suffered any lessening of power, but that He was giving example to our weakness. When He willed it, He was taken; when He willed it, He was put to death. <span class="w">John x. 18.</span> But, since He was to have members, that is, His faithful people, who would not have that power over their lives which He, our God, had over His, He hid Himself, He concealed Himself, as if it were to escape being put to death, to show what should be done by those His members in whom He should dwell.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto thee.<br />
* Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> O Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

Christ is not the Head of His Church in such sense that He is not in her Body; but the whole Christ is in the Head, and the whole Christ is in the Body. That, then, which His members are is Himself, though That Which He is, That are not therefore His members. For if His members had not been indeed His Own, how had He said unto Saul, <span class="w">Acts ix. 4</span>: Why persecutest thou Me? since Saul was not persecuting Him in Himself, but in His members, that is, in His faithful ones which were upon earth. He said not: Why persecutest thou My holy ones, nor: My servants, no, nor yet called He them by that more honourable name “My brethren”, but, “Why persecutest thou Me?”; that is, the members of My Body, whose Head I am.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Make not my soul to perish with sinners, O God, nor my life with bloody men.<br />
* Redeem me, O Lord!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man, preserve me from the wicked man.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Redeem me, O Lord!<br />
<span class="w">omit Glory be</span><br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Make not my soul to perish with sinners, O God, nor my life with bloody men. Redeem me, O Lord!<br />
