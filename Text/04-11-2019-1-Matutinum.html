<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>ing, my tongue, the glorious battle<br />
Sing the last, the dread affray;<br />
O'er the cross, the victor's trophy,<br />
Sound the high triumphal lay:<br />
Tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer,<br />
As a victim won the day.<br />
 <br />
God, his Maker, sorely grieving<br />
That the first-made Adam fell,<br />
When he ate the fruit of sorrow,<br />
Whose reward was death and hell,<br />
Noted then this wood, the ruin<br />
Of the ancient wood to quell.<br />
 <br />
For the work of our salvation<br />
Needs would have his order so,<br />
And the multiform deceiver's<br />
Art by art would overthrow,<br />
And from thence would bring the med'cine<br />
Whence the insult of the foe.<br />
 <br />
Wherefore, when the sacred fullness<br />
Of the appointed time was come, <br />
This world's Maker left his Father,<br />
Sent the heav'nly mansion from, <br />
And proceeded, God Incarnate, <br />
Of the Virgin's holy womb.<br />
 <br />
Weeps the infant in the manger<br />
That in Bethlehem's stable stands;<br />
And his limbs the Virgin Mother<br />
Doth compose in swaddling bands,<br />
Meetly thus in linen folding<br />
Of her God the feet and hands.<br />
 <br />
To the Trinity be glory<br />
Everlasting, as is meet;<br />
Equal to the Father, equal<br />
To the Son, and Paraclete:<br />
Trinal Unity, whose praises<br />
All created things repeat.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">61:3</span>  For he is my God and my saviour: * he is my protector, I shall be moved no more.<br />
<span class="w">61:4</span>  How long do you rush in upon a man? * you all kill, as if you were thrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.<br />
<span class="w">61:5</span>  But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst: * they blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.<br />
<span class="w">61:6</span>  But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: * for from him is my patience.<br />
<span class="w">61:7</span>  For he is my God and my saviour: * he is my helper, I shall not be moved.<br />

<span class="w">61:12</span>  God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power belongeth to God, and mercy to thee, O Lord; * for thou wilt render to every man according to his works.<br />

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke<br />
<span class="ri">Luke 7:36-50</span><br />
In that time, one of the Pharisees desired him to eat with him. And he went into the house of the Pharisee, And so on.<br />

When I think of the repentance of Mary Magdalene I feel nigher to weep than to say ought. Is there indeed any man, however stony his heart, who is not somewhat moved to follow the example of her repentance by the tears of that poor sinful woman? She weighed what she did, and would not that what she did should be niggardly. She came unbidden among the guests, and obtruded her tears upon the banquet. Ye may hence gather her sorrow, that she was content to weep at a feast.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, and out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.<br />
* For Thou art my hope.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> O my God, be not far from me O my God, make haste for my help.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For Thou art my hope.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

We believe that this woman, of whom Luke saith that she was a woman in the city, which was a sinner, and whom John nameth Mary, <span class="w">xi. 2,</span> was the same as she of whom it is written in Mark <span class="w">xvi. 9</span> that the Lord had cast out of her seven devils. And what signify seven devils but all manner of sin? For even as seven days do represent all time, so doth the number seven stand for all. Therefore is it said that Mary had seven devils, because she was full of all sin.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They be increased that trouble me, and that say There is no help for him in his God.<br />
* Arise, O Lord! Save me, O my God!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Lest mine enemy say I have prevailed against him.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Arise, O Lord! Save me, O my God!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

But see how she realized the depth of her own filthiness, and came to be washed to the Well of Mercy, before all them which were bidden to the feast. The bitterness of her inward shame made her esteem it a light thing to be despised outwardly. At what then do we marvel, my brethren? That she came, or that the Lord welcomed her? Or would it be truer for me to say that He drew her to Him and welcomed her when she came? for His mercy inwardly drew her, and, when she came, His gentleness openly welcomed her.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
