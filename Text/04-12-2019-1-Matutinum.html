<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>ing, my tongue, the glorious battle<br />
Sing the last, the dread affray;<br />
O'er the cross, the victor's trophy,<br />
Sound the high triumphal lay:<br />
Tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer,<br />
As a victim won the day.<br />
 <br />
God, his Maker, sorely grieving<br />
That the first-made Adam fell,<br />
When he ate the fruit of sorrow,<br />
Whose reward was death and hell,<br />
Noted then this wood, the ruin<br />
Of the ancient wood to quell.<br />
 <br />
For the work of our salvation<br />
Needs would have his order so,<br />
And the multiform deceiver's<br />
Art by art would overthrow,<br />
And from thence would bring the med'cine<br />
Whence the insult of the foe.<br />
 <br />
Wherefore, when the sacred fullness<br />
Of the appointed time was come, <br />
This world's Maker left his Father,<br />
Sent the heav'nly mansion from, <br />
And proceeded, God Incarnate, <br />
Of the Virgin's holy womb.<br />
 <br />
Weeps the infant in the manger<br />
That in Bethlehem's stable stands;<br />
And his limbs the Virgin Mother<br />
Doth compose in swaddling bands,<br />
Meetly thus in linen folding<br />
Of her God the feet and hands.<br />
 <br />
To the Trinity be glory<br />
Everlasting, as is meet;<br />
Equal to the Father, equal<br />
To the Son, and Paraclete:<br />
Trinal Unity, whose praises<br />
All created things repeat.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord set up a testimony in Jacob: * and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(1-8)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:1</span>  Attend, O my people, to my law: * incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">77:2</span>  I will open my mouth in parables: * I will utter propositions from the beginning.<br />
<span class="w">77:3</span>  How great things have we heard and known, * and our fathers have told us.<br />
<span class="w">77:4</span>  They have not been hidden from their children, * in another generation.<br />
<span class="w">77:4</span>  Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, * and his wonders which he hath done.<br />
<span class="w">77:5</span>  And he set up a testimony in Jacob: * and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="w">77:5</span>  How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: * that another generation might know them.<br />
<span class="w">77:6</span>  The children that should be born and should rise up, * and declare them to their children.<br />
<span class="w">77:7</span>  That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: * and may seek his commandments.<br />
<span class="w">77:8</span>  That they may not become like their fathers, * a perverse and exasperating generation.<br />
<span class="w">77:8</span>  A generation that set not their heart aright: * and whose spirit was not faithful to God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord did wonderful things * in the sight of their fathers.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(9-16)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:9</span>  The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: * they have turned back in the day of battle.<br />
<span class="w">77:10</span>  They kept not the covenant of God: * and in his law they would not walk.<br />
<span class="w">77:11</span>  And they forgot his benefits, * and his wonders that he had shewn them.<br />
<span class="w">77:12</span>  Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, * in the field of Tanis.<br />
<span class="w">77:13</span>  He divided the sea and brought them through: * and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.<br />
<span class="w">77:14</span>  And he conducted them with a cloud by day: * and all the night with a light of fire.<br />
<span class="w">77:15</span>  He struck the rock in the wilderness: * and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.<br />
<span class="w">77:16</span>  He brought forth water out of the rock: * and made streams run down as rivers.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord did wonderful things in the sight of their fathers.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord opened * the doors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(17-31)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:17</span>  And they added yet more sin against him: * they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.<br />
<span class="w">77:18</span>  And they tempted God in their hearts, * by asking meat for their desires.<br />
<span class="w">77:19</span>  And they spoke ill of God: * they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?<br />
<span class="w">77:20</span>  Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, * and the streams overflowed.<br />
<span class="w">77:20</span>  Can he also give bread, * or provide a table for his people?<br />
<span class="w">77:21</span>  Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: * and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.<br />
<span class="w">77:22</span>  Because they believed not in God: * and trusted not in his salvation.<br />
<span class="w">77:23</span>  And he had commanded the clouds from above, * and had opened the doors of heaven.<br />
<span class="w">77:24</span>  And had rained down manna upon them to eat, * and had given them the bread of heaven.<br />
<span class="w">77:25</span>  Man ate the bread of angels: * he sent them provisions in abundance.<br />
<span class="w">77:26</span>  He removed the south wind from heaven: * and by his power brought in the southwest wind.<br />
<span class="w">77:27</span>  And he rained upon them flesh as dust: * and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.<br />
<span class="w">77:28</span>  And they fell in the midst of their camp, * round about their pavilions.<br />
<span class="w">77:29</span>  So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: * they were not defrauded of that which they craved.<br />
<span class="w">77:30</span>  As yet their meat was in their mouth: * and the wrath of God came upon them.<br />
<span class="w">77:31</span>  And he slew the fat ones amongst them, * and brought down the chosen men of Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord opened the doors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> God is their helper, * and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(32-41)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:32</span>  In all these things they sinned still: * and they believed not for his wondrous works.<br />
<span class="w">77:33</span>  And their days were consumed in vanity, * and their years in haste.<br />
<span class="w">77:34</span>  When he slew them, then they sought him: * and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.<br />
<span class="w">77:35</span>  And they remembered that God was their helper: * and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="w">77:36</span>  And they loved him with their mouth: * and with their tongue they lied unto him:<br />
<span class="w">77:37</span>  But their heart was not right with him: * nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.<br />
<span class="w">77:38</span>  But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: * and will not destroy them.<br />
<span class="w">77:38</span>  And many a time did he turn away his anger: * and did not kindle all his wrath.<br />
<span class="w">77:39</span>  And he remembered that they are flesh: * a wind that goeth and returneth not.<br />
<span class="w">77:40</span>  How often did they provoke him in the desert: * and move him to wrath in the place without water?<br />
<span class="w">77:41</span>  And they turned back and tempted God: * and grieved the holy one of Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> God is their helper, and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord redeemed them * from the hand of him that afflicted them.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(42-58)</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:42</span>  They remembered not his hand, * in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:<br />
<span class="w">77:43</span>  How he wrought his signs in Egypt, * and his wonders in the field of Tanis.<br />
<span class="w">77:44</span>  And he turned their rivers into blood, * and their showers that they might, not drink.<br />
<span class="w">77:45</span>  He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them: * and frogs which destroyed them.<br />
<span class="w">77:46</span>  And he gave up their fruits to the blast, * and their labours to the locust.<br />
<span class="w">77:47</span>  And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, * and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.<br />
<span class="w">77:48</span>  And he gave up their cattle to the hail, * and their stock to the fire.<br />
<span class="w">77:49</span>  And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: * indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.<br />
<span class="w">77:50</span>  He made a way for a path to his anger: * he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.<br />
<span class="w">77:51</span>  And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: * the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.<br />
<span class="w">77:52</span>  And he took away his own people as sheep: * and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br />
<span class="w">77:53</span>  And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: * and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br />
<span class="w">77:54</span>  And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: * the mountain which his right hand had purchased.<br />
<span class="w">77:54</span>  And he cast out the Gentiles before them: * and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.<br />
<span class="w">77:55</span>  And he made the tribes of Israel * to dwell in their tabernacles.<br />
<span class="w">77:56</span>  Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: * and they kept not his testimonies.<br />
<span class="w">77:57</span>  And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: * even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.<br />
<span class="w">77:58</span>  They provoked him to anger on their hills: * and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 77(59-72)</span><em> [6]</em><br />

<span class="w">77:60</span>  And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, * his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.<br />
<span class="w">77:61</span>  And he delivered their strength into captivity: * and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.<br />
<span class="w">77:62</span>  And he shut up his people under the sword: * and he despised his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">77:63</span>  Fire consumed their young men: * and their maidens were not lamented.<br />
<span class="w">77:64</span>  Their priests fell by the sword: * and their widows did not mourn.<br />
<span class="w">77:65</span>  And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, * and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.<br />
<span class="w">77:66</span>  And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: * he put them to an everlasting reproach.<br />
<span class="w">77:67</span>  And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: * and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:<br />
<span class="w">77:68</span>  But he chose the tribe of Juda, * mount Sion which he loved.<br />
<span class="w">77:69</span>  And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land * which he founded for ever.<br />
<span class="w">77:70</span>  And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: * he brought him from following the ewes great with young,<br />
<span class="w">77:71</span>  To feed Jacob his servant, * and Israel his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">77:72</span>  And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: * and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands.<br />

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 11:47-54</span><br />
At that time, chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles? If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo.</span><br />
<span class="ri">49th Tract on John</span><br />
The chief Priests and the Pharisees took counsel together, but Let us believe in Him was not one of the suggestions offered. Those lost creatures thought much more how they might hurt and undo Him, than how they might save themselves from perishing. And yet they were afraid, and took counsel together, and said What do we? For this Man doeth many miracles. If we let Him thus alone, all men will believe on Him; and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and our nation. They were afraid of losing temporal things, but they gave no thought to eternal life, and so they lost both.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thou art my God; be not far from me, for trouble is near;<br />
* For there is none to help.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But be not thy strength far from me; O Lord, haste thee to help me.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For trouble is near; for there is none to help.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

For, after that the Lord had suffered and been glorified, first came the Romans, and took away both their place and nation, prevailing against them and leading them away captive, and secondly there followeth them that which is written But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness. <span class="w">Matth. viii. 12.</span> But their fear was that, if all men should believe on Christ, none would remain to defend the city of God and His Temple against the Romans, since they deemed that Christ's teaching was against the Temple itself, and against the laws of their fathers.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I was cast upon thee from the womb; Thou art my God from my mother's belly; be not far from me.<br />
* For trouble is near, and there is none to help.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Save me from the lion's mouth, and mine affliction from the horns of the unicorns.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For trouble is near, and there is none to help.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

And one of them, named Ca'iphas, being the High Priest that same year, said unto them: Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. And this spake he not of himself but being High Priest that year, he prophesied. Here we will learn that bad men are enabled by the spirit of prophecy to foretell the future; which, at the same time, the Evangelist attributeth to an ordinance of God, namely, that he was the High Priest.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O Lord, my trouble is near, and there is none to help me; or ever they pierce my hands and my feet, save me from the lion's mouth!<br />
* That I may declare thy Name unto my brethren.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> O God, deliver my soul from the sword, and my darling from the power of the dog.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> That I may declare thy Name unto my brethren.<br />
<span class="w">omit Glory be</span><br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O Lord, my trouble is near, and there is none to help me; or ever they pierce my hands and my feet, save me from the lion's mouth! that I may declare thy Name unto my brethren.<br />
