<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.<br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">50:13</span>  Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br />
<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />

<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />

<span class="w">142:4</span>  He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been dead of old: * and my spirit is in anguish within me: my heart within me is troubled.<br />
<span class="w">142:5</span>  I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all thy works: * I meditated upon the works of thy hands.<br />
<span class="w">142:6</span>  I stretched forth my hands to thee: * my soul is as earth without water unto thee.<br />
<span class="w">142:7</span>  Hear me speedily, O Lord: * my spirit hath fainted away.<br />

<span class="w">84:8</span>  Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; * and grant us thy salvation.<br />
<span class="w">84:9</span>  I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: * for he will speak peace<br />

<span class="w">84:10</span>  Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him: * that glory may dwell in our land.<br />
<span class="w">84:11</span>  Mercy and truth have met each other: * justice and peace have kissed.<br />
<span class="w">84:12</span>  Truth is sprung out of the earth: * and justice hath looked down from heaven.<br />
<span class="w">84:13</span>  For the Lord will give goodness: * and our earth shall yield her fruit.<br />

<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">T</i>hirty years among us dwelling, <br />
His appointed time fulfilled, <br />
Born for this, he meets his passion,<br />
For that this he freely willed:<br />
On the cross the Lamb is lifted, <br />
Where his life-blood shall be spilled.<br />
 <br />
He endured the nails, the spitting,<br />
Vinegar, and spear, and reed;<br />
From that holy body broken<br />
Blood and water forth proceed:<br />
Earth, and stars, and sky, and ocean,<br />
By that flood from stain are free.<br />
 <br />
Faithful cross! above all other,<br />
One and only noble tree!<br />
None in foliage, none in blossom,<br />
None in fruit thy peers may be;<br />
Sweetest wood and sweetest iron!<br />
Sweetest weight is hung on thee.<br />
 <br />
Bend thy boughs, O tree of glory!<br />
Thy relaxing sinews bend;<br />
For awhile the ancient rigour,<br />
That thy birth bestowed, suspend;<br />
And the King of heavenly beauty<br />
On thy bosom gently tend!<br />
 <br />
Thou alone wast counted worthy<br />
This world's ransom to uphold;<br />
For a shipwrecked race preparing<br />
Harbour, like the ark of old;<br />
With the sacred blood anointed<br />
From the smitten Lamb that rolled.<br />
 <br />
To the Trinity be glory<br />
Everlasting, as is meet;<br />
Equal to the Father, equal<br />
To the Son, and Paraclete:<br />
Trinal Unity, whose praises<br />
All created things repeat.<br />
