<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>ing, my tongue, the glorious battle<br />
Sing the last, the dread affray;<br />
O'er the cross, the victor's trophy,<br />
Sound the high triumphal lay:<br />
Tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer,<br />
As a victim won the day.<br />
 <br />
God, his Maker, sorely grieving<br />
That the first-made Adam fell,<br />
When he ate the fruit of sorrow,<br />
Whose reward was death and hell,<br />
Noted then this wood, the ruin<br />
Of the ancient wood to quell.<br />
 <br />
For the work of our salvation<br />
Needs would have his order so,<br />
And the multiform deceiver's<br />
Art by art would overthrow,<br />
And from thence would bring the med'cine<br />
Whence the insult of the foe.<br />
 <br />
Wherefore, when the sacred fullness<br />
Of the appointed time was come, <br />
This world's Maker left his Father,<br />
Sent the heav'nly mansion from, <br />
And proceeded, God Incarnate, <br />
Of the Virgin's holy womb.<br />
 <br />
Weeps the infant in the manger<br />
That in Bethlehem's stable stands;<br />
And his limbs the Virgin Mother<br />
Doth compose in swaddling bands,<br />
Meetly thus in linen folding<br />
Of her God the feet and hands.<br />
 <br />
To the Trinity be glory<br />
Everlasting, as is meet;<br />
Equal to the Father, equal<br />
To the Son, and Paraclete:<br />
Trinal Unity, whose praises<br />
All created things repeat.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">104:11</span>  Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, * the lot of your inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">104:12</span>  When they were but a small number: * yea very few, and sojourners therein:<br />
<span class="w">104:13</span>  And they passed from nation to nation, * and from one kingdom to another people.<br />

<span class="w">104:17</span>  He sent a man before them: * Joseph, who was sold for a slave.<br />
<span class="w">104:18</span>  They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul, * until his word came.<br />
<span class="w">104:19</span>  The word of the Lord inflamed him: * the king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty.<br />
<span class="w">104:21</span>  He made him master of his house, * and ruler of all his possession.<br />
<span class="w">104:22</span>  That he might instruct his princes as himself, * and teach his ancients wisdom.<br />
<span class="w">104:23</span>  And Israel went into Egypt: * and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham.<br />
<span class="w">104:24</span>  And he increased his people exceedingly: * and strengthened them over their enemies,<br />
<span class="w">104:25</span>  He turned their heart to hate his people: * and to deal deceitfully with his servants.<br />
<span class="w">104:26</span>  He sent Moses his servant: * Aaron the man whom he had chosen.<br />
<span class="w">104:27</span>  He gave them power to shew his signs, * and his wonders in the land of Cham.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">104:30</span>  Their land brought forth frogs, * in the inner chambers of their kings.<br />
<span class="w">104:31</span>  He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies, * and sciniphs in all their coasts.<br />
<span class="w">104:32</span>  He gave them hail for rain, * a burning fire in the land.<br />
<span class="w">104:33</span>  And he destroyed their vineyards, and their fig trees: * and he broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.<br />
<span class="w">104:34</span>  He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, * of which there was no number.<br />
<span class="w">104:35</span>  And they devoured all the grass in their land, * and consumed all the fruit of their ground.<br />
<span class="w">104:36</span>  And he slew all the firstborn in their land: * the firstfruits of all their labour.<br />
<span class="w">104:37</span>  And he brought them out with silver and gold: * and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble.<br />
<span class="w">104:38</span>  Egypt was glad when they departed: * for the fear of them lay upon them.<br />
<span class="w">104:39</span>  He spread a cloud for their protection, * and fire to give them light in the night.<br />

<span class="w">105:39</span>  And the land was polluted with blood, and was defiled with their works: * and they went aside after their own inventions.<br />
<span class="w">105:40</span>  And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: * and he abhorred his inheritance.<br />

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 12:10-36</span><br />
In that time, the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also: Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo)<br />
<span class="ri">50th Tract on John</span><br />
When they saw Lazarus who had been raised from the dead, and knew that the miracle which the Lord had worked was so great, spread about by so many witnesses, and so plain and manifest that it could neither be concealed nor denied, they invented an expedient; and see here what it was: “But the chief Priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death." What stupidity of thought, what blindness of cruelty is here! If the Lord Christ had raised up again a man who had died a natural death, could He not also raise up one that had died by violence? Would killing Lazarus paralyse the Lord? But if ye consider that there is a difference between a man dead of disease, and a man killed, behold, the Lord hath raised up both for He first raised up Lazarus, who had died a natural death, and then Himself, after a violent one.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O Lord, I go mourning all the day long, for my soul is filled with a loathsome disease<br />
* They also that sought after my life have used violence against me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> My friends and my neighbours draw near, and stand over against me; and they that are nearest to me stand afar off.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They also that sought after my life have used violence against me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

"On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to meet Him, and cried Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel That cometh in the Name of the Lord!" Palm branches are glorious boughs which tell of victory; yea, the Lord was now ready by His Own Death to trample down death, and to carry the victorious banner of His Cross in triumph over the devil, the prince of death. The cry with which He was greeted, namely "Hosanna," hath not, as we are assured by some who are acquainted with the Hebrew language, any meaning in particular, but is a shout after the manner of interjections, as they are called, just as in Latin when we lament we say "Heu," or when we are pleased, "Vah."<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O Lord, hide not thy face from thy servant<br />
* For I am in trouble; hear me speedily.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; deliver me, because of mine enemies.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For I am in trouble; hear me speedily.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

These were the shouts of applause with which the crowd greeted Him, "Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel That cometh in the Name of the Lord!" What inward torture must the jealousy of the Jewish leaders have caused them, when they heard that great multitude hailing Christ as their King! But, for the Lord, what was it to be King of Israel? To the Eternal King what mattered it to become a King of men? And Christ is not King of Israel in the sense of monarchs who exact tribute, or arm hosts with steel to conquer enemies that are seen. But King of Israel He is, as He Who is Lord of our intellect, a Ruler Whose power shall never wane, and Who openeth a Kingdom in heaven to all such as centre in Him their faith, their hope, and their love.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night! for my nearest brother hath supplanted me,<br />
* And my neighbour hath walked with slanders against me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the Angel of the Lord persecute them.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And my neighbour hath walked with slanders against me.<br />
<span class="w">omit Glory be</span><br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night! for my nearest brother hath supplanted me, and my neighbour hath walked with slanders against me.<br />
