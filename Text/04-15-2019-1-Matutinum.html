<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>ing, my tongue, the glorious battle<br />
Sing the last, the dread affray;<br />
O'er the cross, the victor's trophy,<br />
Sound the high triumphal lay:<br />
Tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer,<br />
As a victim won the day.<br />
 <br />
God, his Maker, sorely grieving<br />
That the first-made Adam fell,<br />
When he ate the fruit of sorrow,<br />
Whose reward was death and hell,<br />
Noted then this wood, the ruin<br />
Of the ancient wood to quell.<br />
 <br />
For the work of our salvation<br />
Needs would have his order so,<br />
And the multiform deceiver's<br />
Art by art would overthrow,<br />
And from thence would bring the med'cine<br />
Whence the insult of the foe.<br />
 <br />
Wherefore, when the sacred fullness<br />
Of the appointed time was come, <br />
This world's Maker left his Father,<br />
Sent the heav'nly mansion from, <br />
And proceeded, God Incarnate, <br />
Of the Virgin's holy womb.<br />
 <br />
Weeps the infant in the manger<br />
That in Bethlehem's stable stands;<br />
And his limbs the Virgin Mother<br />
Doth compose in swaddling bands,<br />
Meetly thus in linen folding<br />
Of her God the feet and hands.<br />
 <br />
To the Trinity be glory<br />
Everlasting, as is meet;<br />
Equal to the Father, equal<br />
To the Son, and Paraclete:<br />
Trinal Unity, whose praises<br />
All created things repeat.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven * upon the children of men.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 13</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  The fool hath said in his heart: * there is no God.<br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: * there is none that doth good, no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:2</span>  The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see if there be any that understand and seek God.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: * there is none that doth good: no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: * the poison of asps is under their lips.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; * their feet are swift to shed blood.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Destruction and unhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: * there is no fear of God before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">13:4</span>  Shall not all they know that work iniquity, * who devour my people as they eat bread?<br />
<span class="w">13:5</span>  They have not called upon the Lord: * there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.<br />
<span class="w">13:6</span>  For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man; * but the Lord is his hope.<br />
<span class="w">13:7</span>  Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? * when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> He who worketh justice * may rest on thy holy mountain, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 14</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">14:1</span>  Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest in thy holy hill?<br />
<span class="w">14:2</span>  He that walketh without blemish, * and worketh justice:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  He that speaketh truth in his heart, * who hath not used deceit in his tongue:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: * nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.<br />
<span class="w">14:4</span>  In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: * but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not; * He that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that doth these things, * shall not be moved for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> He who worketh justice may rest on thy holy mountain, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, incline * thy ear to me, and hear my voice, my Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 16</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">16:1</span>  Hear, O Lord, my justice: * attend to my supplication.<br />
<span class="w">16:1</span>  Give ear unto my prayer, * which proceedeth not from deceitful lips.<br />
<span class="w">16:2</span>  Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: * let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable.<br />
<span class="w">16:3</span>  Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, * thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.<br />
<span class="w">16:4</span>  That my mouth may not speak the works of men: * for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.<br />
<span class="w">16:5</span>  Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: * that my footsteps be not moved.<br />
<span class="w">16:6</span>  I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: * O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.<br />
<span class="w">16:7</span>  Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; * thou who savest them that trust in thee.<br />
<span class="w">16:8</span>  From them that resist thy right hand keep me, * as the apple of thy eye.<br />
<span class="w">16:9</span>  Protect me under the shadow of thy wings. * from the face of the wicked who have afflicted me.<br />
<span class="w">16:10</span>  My enemies have surrounded my soul: They have shut up their fat: * their mouth hath spoken proudly.<br />
<span class="w">16:11</span>  They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: * they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.<br />
<span class="w">16:12</span>  They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; * and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.<br />
<span class="w">16:13</span>  Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; * deliver my soul from the wicked one; thy sword from the enemies of thy hand.<br />
<span class="w">16:14</span>  O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: * their belly is filled from thy hidden stores.<br />
<span class="w">16:14</span>  They are full of children: * and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.<br />
<span class="w">16:15</span>  But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: * I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 17(2-16)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">17:2</span>  I will love thee, O Lord, my strength: * The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer.<br />
<span class="w">17:3</span>  My God is my helper, * and in him will I put my trust.<br />
<span class="w">17:3</span>  My protector, and the horn of my salvation, * and my support.<br />
<span class="w">17:4</span>  Praising, I will call upon the Lord: * and I shall be saved from my enemies.<br />
<span class="w">17:5</span>  The sorrows of death surrounded me: * and the torrents of iniquity troubled me.<br />
<span class="w">17:6</span>  The sorrows of hell encompassed me: * and the snares of death prevented me.<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  In my affliction I called upon the Lord, * and I cried to my God:<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  And he heard my voice from his holy temple: * and my cry before him came into his ears.<br />
<span class="w">17:8</span>  The earth shook and trembled: * the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them.<br />
<span class="w">17:9</span>  There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his face: * coals were kindled by it.<br />
<span class="w">17:10</span>  He bowed the heavens, and came down, * and darkness was under his feet.<br />
<span class="w">17:11</span>  And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; * he flew upon the wings of the winds.<br />
<span class="w">17:12</span>  And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him: * dark waters in the clouds of the air.<br />
<span class="w">17:13</span>  At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, * hail and coals of fire.<br />
<span class="w">17:14</span>  And the Lord thundered from heaven, * and the Highest gave his voice: * hail and coals of fire.<br />
<span class="w">17:15</span>  And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: * he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  Then the fountains of waters appeared, * and the foundations of the world were discovered:<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  At thy rebuke, O Lord, * at the blast of the spirit of thy wrath.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">17:19</span>  They prevented me in the day of my affliction: * and the Lord became my protector.<br />
<span class="w">17:20</span>  And he brought me forth into a large place: * he saved me, because he was well pleased with me.<br />
<span class="w">17:21</span>  And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; * and will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:<br />
<span class="w">17:22</span>  Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; * and have not done wickedly against my God.<br />

<span class="w">17:24</span>  And I shall be spotless with him: * and shall keep myself from my iniquity.<br />

<span class="w">17:27</span>  And with the elect thou wilt be elect: * and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted.<br />

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 12:1-9</span><br />
Six days before the pasch, Jesus came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo.</span><br />
<span class="ri">50th Tract on John</span><br />
There they made Him a supper and Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table lest men should deem that it was but by an ocular delusion that they had seen him arise from the dead. He lived therefore, spake, and ate; to the manifestation of the truth, and the confusion of the unbelieving Jews. Jesus, then, sat down to meat with Lazarus and others, and Martha, being one of Lazarus' sisters, served. But Mary, Lazarus' other sister, took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the Feet of Jesus, and wiped His Feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. We have now heard that which was done; let us search out the mystic meaning thereof.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The ungodly said: Let us oppress the righteous man without cause, and swallow him up alive, as the grave; let us make his memorial to perish from the earth, and cast lots among us for his spoils and those murderers laid by store for themselves, but of evil.<br />
* Fools and haters loathe wisdom, and are guilty in their thoughts.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Such things they did imagine, and were deceived, for their own wickedness blinded them.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Fools and haters loathe wisdom, and are guilty in their thoughts.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

Whatsover thou art that wilt be a faithful soul, seek with Mary to anoint the Feet of the Lord with costly ointment. This ointment was a figure of justice, and therefore is there said to have been a pound thereof, a pound being a weight used in scales. The word pistikes used by the Evangelist as the name of this ointment, we must believe to be that of some place, from which this costly perfume was imported. Neither is this name meaningless for us, but agreeth well with our mystic interpretation, since Pistis is the Greek word which signifieth Faith, and whosoever will do justice must know that: The just shall live by faith. <span class="w">Rom. i. 17; Hab. ii. 4.</span> Anoint therefore the Feet of Jesus by thy good life, following in the marks which those Feet of the Lord have traced. Wipe His Feet likewise with thy hair; that is, if thou have aught which is not needful to thee, give it to the poor; and then thou hast wiped the Feet of Jesus with thy hair, that is, with that which thou needest not, and which is therefore to thee as is hair, being a needless out-growth to the body. Here thou hast what to do with that which thou needest not. To thee it is needless, but the Lord's Feet have need of it; yea, the Feet which the Lord hath on earth are sorely needy.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I became a reproach unto mine enemies they looked upon me and shaked their heads.<br />
* Help me, O Lord my God!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> They have spoken against me with a lying tongue they compassed me about also with words of hatred.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Help me, O Lord my God!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

For of whom save of His members, will He say at the latter day: Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me. <span class="w">Matth. xxv. 40.</span> That is, ye have spent nothing save that which ye needed not, but ye have ministered unto My Feet. And the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. That is, the fragrance of your good example filleth the world; for this odour is a figure of reputation. They which are called Christians, and yet live bad lives, cast a slur on Christ and it is even such as they unto whom it is said: The Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you. <span class="w">Rom. ii. 24; Ezek. xxxvi. 20, 23.</span> But if, through such, the Name of God be blasphemed, through the godly is praise ascribed to the Same His Holy Name, as the Apostle doth likewise say: In every place we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish. <span class="w">2 Cor. ii. 14, 15.</span><br />

<span class="ri">V.</span> They poured forth their fury upon me, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.<br />
