<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>ing, my tongue, the glorious battle<br />
Sing the last, the dread affray;<br />
O'er the cross, the victor's trophy,<br />
Sound the high triumphal lay:<br />
Tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer,<br />
As a victim won the day.<br />
 <br />
God, his Maker, sorely grieving<br />
That the first-made Adam fell,<br />
When he ate the fruit of sorrow,<br />
Whose reward was death and hell,<br />
Noted then this wood, the ruin<br />
Of the ancient wood to quell.<br />
 <br />
For the work of our salvation<br />
Needs would have his order so,<br />
And the multiform deceiver's<br />
Art by art would overthrow,<br />
And from thence would bring the med'cine<br />
Whence the insult of the foe.<br />
 <br />
Wherefore, when the sacred fullness<br />
Of the appointed time was come, <br />
This world's Maker left his Father,<br />
Sent the heav'nly mansion from, <br />
And proceeded, God Incarnate, <br />
Of the Virgin's holy womb.<br />
 <br />
Weeps the infant in the manger<br />
That in Bethlehem's stable stands;<br />
And his limbs the Virgin Mother<br />
Doth compose in swaddling bands,<br />
Meetly thus in linen folding<br />
Of her God the feet and hands.<br />
 <br />
To the Trinity be glory<br />
Everlasting, as is meet;<br />
Equal to the Father, equal<br />
To the Son, and Paraclete:<br />
Trinal Unity, whose praises<br />
All created things repeat.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">34:2</span>  Take hold of arms and shield: * and rise up to help me.<br />

<span class="w">34:4</span>  Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek after my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:4</span>  Let them be turned back and be confounded * that devise against me.<br />

<span class="w">34:6</span>  Let their way become dark and slippery; * and let the Angel of the Lord pursue them.<br />
<span class="w">34:7</span>  For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: * without cause they have upbraided my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:8</span>  Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: * and into that very snare let them fall.<br />
<span class="w">34:9</span>  But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; * and shall be delighted in his salvation.<br />
<span class="w">34:10</span>  All my bones shall say: * Lord, who is like to thee?<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 34(11-17)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">34:11</span>  Unjust witnesses rising up * have asked me things I knew not.<br />
<span class="w">34:12</span>  They repaid me evil for good: * to the depriving me of my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:13</span>  But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, * I was clothed with haircloth.<br />

<span class="w">34:14</span>  As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: * as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.<br />

<span class="w">34:16</span>  They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: * they gnashed upon me with their teeth.<br />

<span class="w">34:19</span>  Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: * who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">34:20</span>  For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; * and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.<br />
<span class="w">34:21</span>  And they opened their mouth wide against me; * they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.<br />
<span class="w">34:22</span>  Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: * O Lord, depart not from me.<br />
<span class="w">34:23</span>  Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: * to my cause, my God, and my Lord.<br />
<span class="w">34:24</span>  Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, * and let them not rejoice over me.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Envy not * the man who prospereth in his way; the man who doth unjust things.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 36(1-15)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:1</span>  Be not emulous of evildoers; * nor envy them that work iniquity.<br />

<span class="w">36:4</span>  Delight in the Lord, * and he will give thee the requests of thy heart.<br />
<span class="w">36:5</span>  Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, * and he will do it.<br />
<span class="w">36:6</span>  And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday: * be subject to the Lord and pray to him.<br />
<span class="w">36:7</span>  Envy not the man who prospereth in his way; * the man who doth unjust things.<br />
<span class="w">36:8</span>  Cease from anger, and leave rage; * have no emulation to do evil.<br />
<span class="w">36:9</span>  For the evildoers shall be cut off: * but they that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the land.<br />
<span class="w">36:10</span>  For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: * and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.<br />
<span class="w">36:11</span>  But the meek shall inherit the land, * and shall delight in abundance of peace.<br />
<span class="w">36:12</span>  The sinner shall watch the just man: * and shall gnash upon him with his teeth.<br />

<span class="w">36:19</span>  They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled, * because the wicked shall perish.<br />
<span class="w">36:20</span>  And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, * shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke.<br />
<span class="w">36:21</span>  The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; * but the just sheweth mercy and shall give.<br />
<span class="w">36:22</span>  For such as bless him shall inherit the land: * but such as curse him shall perish.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Keep innocence * and behold justice.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 36(30-40)</span><em> [6]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:30</span>  The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom: * and his tongue shall speak judgment.<br />
<span class="w">36:31</span>  The law of his God is in his heart, * and his steps shall not be supplanted.<br />
<span class="w">36:32</span>  The wicked watcheth the just man, * and seeketh to put him to death.<br />
<span class="w">36:33</span>  But the Lord will not leave him in his hands; * nor condemn him when he shall be judged.<br />
<span class="w">36:34</span>  Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: * when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.<br />
<span class="w">36:35</span>  I have seen the wicked highly exalted, * and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus.<br />
<span class="w">36:36</span>  And I passed by, and lo, he was not: * and I sought him and his place was not found.<br />
<span class="w">36:37</span>  Keep innocence, and behold justice: * for there are remnants for the peaceable man.<br />
<span class="w">36:38</span>  But the unjust shall be destroyed together: * the remnants of the wicked shall perish.<br />
<span class="w">36:39</span>  But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, * and he is their protector in the time of trouble.<br />
<span class="w">36:40</span>  And the Lord will help them and deliver them: * and he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them, because they have hoped in him.<br />

Lesson from the book of Jeremias<br />
<span class="ri">Jer 11:15-20</span><br />
<span class="w">15</span> What is the meaning that my beloved hath wrought much wickedness in my house? shall the holy flesh take away from thee thy crimes, in which thou hast boasted?<br />
<span class="w">16</span> The Lord called thy name, a plentiful olive tree, fair, fruitful, and beautiful: at the noise of a word, a great fire was kindled in it and the branches thereof are burnt.<br />
<span class="w">17</span> And the Lord of hosts that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee: for the evils of the house of Israel, and the house of Juda, which they have done to themselves, to provoke me, offering sacrifice to Baalim.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> But thou, O Lord, hast shewn me, and I have known: then thou shewedst me their doings.<br />
<span class="w">19</span> And I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim: and I knew not that they had devised counsels against me, saying: Let us put wood on his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living, and let his name be remembered no more.<br />
<span class="w">20</span> But thou, O Lord of Sabaoth, who judgest justly, and triest the reins and hearts, let me see thy revenge on them: for to thee I have revealed my cause.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I have suffered defaming and fear from them that were my familiars they watched for my halting, saying Let us entice him, and prevail against him. But Thou, O Lord, art with me, as a Mighty Terrible One.<br />
* Let them stumble into everlasting confusion, that I may see thy vengeance upon them, for unto thee have I opened my cause.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> O Lord, plead Thou the cause of my soul, Thou That art the Redeemer of my life.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Let them stumble into everlasting confusion, that I may see thy vengeance upon them, for unto thee have I opened my cause.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May Christ to all His people give, for ever in His sight to live. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Jer 12:1-4</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> Thou indeed, O Lord, art just, if I plead with thee, but yet I will speak what is just to thee: Why doth the way of the wicked prosper: why is it well with all them that transgress, and do wickedly?<br />
<span class="w">2</span> Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they prosper and bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And thou, O Lord, hast known me, thou hast seen me, and proved my heart with thee: gather them together as sheep for a sacrifice, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? The beasts and the birds are consumed: because they have said: He shall not see our last end.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For thy sake, O God of Israel, I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face; I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.<br />
* For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; deliver me, because of mine enemies.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Spirit's fire Divine in our hearts enkindled shine. Amen. <br />

<span class="ri">Jer 12:7-11</span><br />
<span class="w">7</span> I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance: I have given my dear soul into the land of her enemies.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> My inheritance is become to me as a lion in the wood: it hath cried out against me, therefore have I hated it.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> Is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird? Is it as a bird died throughout? come ye, assemble yourselves, all the beasts of the earth, make haste to devour.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot: they have changed my delightful portion into a desolate wilderness.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> They have laid it waste, and it hath mourned for me. With desolation is all the land made desolate; because there is none that considereth in the heart.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The congregation of the people hath compassed me about, but I rewarded no evil unto him that rewarded evil unto me.<br />
* O Lord, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the just.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O Lord, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the just.<br />
