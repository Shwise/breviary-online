<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>ing, my tongue, the glorious battle<br />
Sing the last, the dread affray;<br />
O'er the cross, the victor's trophy,<br />
Sound the high triumphal lay:<br />
Tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer,<br />
As a victim won the day.<br />
 <br />
God, his Maker, sorely grieving<br />
That the first-made Adam fell,<br />
When he ate the fruit of sorrow,<br />
Whose reward was death and hell,<br />
Noted then this wood, the ruin<br />
Of the ancient wood to quell.<br />
 <br />
For the work of our salvation<br />
Needs would have his order so,<br />
And the multiform deceiver's<br />
Art by art would overthrow,<br />
And from thence would bring the med'cine<br />
Whence the insult of the foe.<br />
 <br />
Wherefore, when the sacred fullness<br />
Of the appointed time was come, <br />
This world's Maker left his Father,<br />
Sent the heav'nly mansion from, <br />
And proceeded, God Incarnate, <br />
Of the Virgin's holy womb.<br />
 <br />
Weeps the infant in the manger<br />
That in Bethlehem's stable stands;<br />
And his limbs the Virgin Mother<br />
Doth compose in swaddling bands,<br />
Meetly thus in linen folding<br />
Of her God the feet and hands.<br />
 <br />
To the Trinity be glory<br />
Everlasting, as is meet;<br />
Equal to the Father, equal<br />
To the Son, and Paraclete:<br />
Trinal Unity, whose praises<br />
All created things repeat.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">13</span> O Lord, the hope of Israel: all that forsake thee shall be confounded: they that depart from thee, shall be written in the earth: because they have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed: save me, and I shall be saved, for thou art my praise.<br />
<span class="w">15</span> Behold they say to me: Where is the word of the Lord? let it come.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> And I am not troubled, following thee for my pastor, and I have not desired the day of man, thou knowest. That which went out of my lips, hath been right in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">17</span> Be not thou a terror unto me, thou art my hope in the day of affliction.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> Let them be confounded that persecute me, and let not me be confounded: let them be afraid, and let not me be afraid: bring upon them the day of affliction, and with a double destruction, destroy them.<br />

<span class="w">13</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord: Ask among the nations: Who hath heard such horrible things, as the virgin of Israel hath done to excess?<br />
<span class="w">14</span> Shall the snow of Libanus fail from the rock of the field? or can the cold waters that gush out and run down, be taken away?<br />
<span class="w">15</span> Because my people have forgotten me, sacrificing in vain, and stumbling in their ways, in ancient paths, to walk by them in a way not trodden:<br />
<span class="w">16</span> That their land might be given up to desolation, and to a perpetual hissing: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and wag his head.<br />
<span class="w">17</span> As a burning will I scatter them before the enemy: I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their destruction.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> And they said: Come, and let us invent devices against Jeremias: for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet: come, and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us give no heed to all his words.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> The wicked people have said, reasoning with themselves, but not right: Let us therefore lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings. He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God:<br />
* Let us see then if his words be true, for if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from our hands, let us examine him by outrages and tortures<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> We are esteemed by him as triflers, and he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness, and he preferreth the latter end of the just.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Let us see then if his words be true, for if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from our hands, let us examine him by outrages and tortures.<br />

<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
<span class="ri">Jer 18:19-23</span><br />
<span class="w">19</span> Give heed to me, O Lord, and hear the voice of my adversaries. <br />
<span class="w">20</span> Shall evil be rendered for good, because they have digged a pit for my soul? Remember that I have stood in thy sight, to speak good for them, and turn away thy indignation from them.<br />
<span class="w">21</span> Therefore deliver up their children to famine, and bring them into the hands of the sword: let their wives be bereaved of children and widows: and let their husbands be slain by death: let their young men be stabbed with the sword in battle. <br />
<span class="w">22</span> Let a cry be heard out of their houses: for thou shalt bring the robber upon them suddenly: because they have digged a pit to take me, and have hid snares for my feet. <br />
<span class="w">23</span> But thou, O Lord, knowest all their counsel against me unto death: forgive not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from thy sight: let them be overthrown before thy eyes, in the time of thy wrath do thou destroy them.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> Lying men surrounded me: without reason they beat me with whips;<br />
* But you Lord, my defender, avenge me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For tribulation is very near: for there is none to help me.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> But you Lord, my defender, avenge me.<br />
