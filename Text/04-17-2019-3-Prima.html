<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Deliver me * from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall extol thy justice.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 25</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">25:1</span>  Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my innocence: * and I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall not be weakened.<br />
<span class="w">25:2</span>  Prove me, O Lord, and try me; * burn my reins and my heart.<br />
<span class="w">25:3</span>  For thy mercy is before my eyes; * and I am well pleased with thy truth.<br />
<span class="w">25:4</span>  I have not sat with the council of vanity: * neither will I go in with the doers of unjust things.<br />
<span class="w">25:5</span>  I have hated the assembly of the malignant; * and with the wicked I will not sit.<br />
<span class="w">25:6</span>  I will wash my hands among the innocent; * and will compass thy altar, O Lord:<br />
<span class="w">25:7</span>  That I may hear the voice of thy praise: * and tell of all thy wondrous works.<br />
<span class="w">25:8</span>  I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of thy house; * and the place where thy glory dwelleth.<br />
<span class="w">25:9</span>  Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked: * nor my life with bloody men:<br />
<span class="w">25:10</span>  In whose hands are iniquities: * their right hand is filled with gifts.<br />
<span class="w">25:11</span>  But as for me, I have walked in my innocence: * redeem me, and have mercy on me.<br />
<span class="w">25:12</span>  My foot hath stood in the direct way: * in the churches I will bless thee, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 51</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">51:3</span>  Why dost thou glory in malice, * thou that art mighty in iniquity?<br />
<span class="w">51:4</span>  All the day long thy tongue hath devised injustice: * as a sharp razor, thou hast wrought deceit.<br />
<span class="w">51:5</span>  Thou hast loved malice more than goodness: * and iniquity rather than to speak righteousness.<br />
<span class="w">51:6</span>  Thou hast loved all the words of ruin, * O deceitful tongue.<br />
<span class="w">51:7</span>  Therefore will God destroy thee for ever: * he will pluck thee out, and remove thee from thy dwelling place: and thy root out of the land of the living.<br />
<span class="w">51:8</span>  The just shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say: * Behold the man that made not God his helper:<br />
<span class="w">51:9</span>  But trusted in the abundance of his riches: * and prevailed in his vanity.<br />
<span class="w">51:10</span>  But I, as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, * have hoped in the mercy of God for ever, yea for ever and ever.<br />
<span class="w">51:11</span>  I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: * and I will wait on thy name, for it is good in the sight of thy saints.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 52</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">52:1</span>  The fool said in his heart: * There is no God.<br />
<span class="w">52:2</span>  They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: * there is none that doth good.<br />
<span class="w">52:3</span>  God looked down from heaven on the children of men: * to see if there were any that did understand, or did seek God.<br />
<span class="w">52:4</span>  All have gone aside, they are become unprofitable together, * there is none that doth good, no not one.<br />
<span class="w">52:5</span>  Shall not all the workers of iniquity know, * who eat up my people as they eat bread?<br />
<span class="w">52:6</span>  They have not called upon God: * there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.<br />
<span class="w">52:6</span>  For God hath scattered the bones of them that please men: * they have been confounded, because God hath despised them.<br />
<span class="w">52:7</span>  Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? * when God shall bring back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<b>A</b>t Rome, under the Emperor Cornmodus and the Prefect Perennius, the blessed Senator Apollonius. A slave informed upon him as being a Christian, and he was commanded to give an account of his faith. In order to do this he wrote an admirable treatise, which he read in the Senate but the Senate, nevertheless, ordered him to be beheaded for Christ's sake. <br />
<b>A</b>t Messina, the holy martyrs Eleutherius, Bishop of Illyrium, and Anthia his mother. He was famous for the holiness of his life, and for his power of working miracles. Under the Emperor Hadrian he was tortured upon a heated iron-bed, a grating, and a vessel filled with boiling oil, pitch, and rosin. These he overcame, and was thrown to the lions but by them he was left unhurt, and in the end his throat was cut along with that of his mother. <br />
<b>L</b>ikewise at Messina, the holy Prefect Corebus, who was converted to the faith by holy Eleutherius, and was slain with the sword. <br />
