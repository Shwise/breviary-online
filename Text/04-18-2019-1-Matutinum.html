<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The zeal of thine house * hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 68</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">68:2</span>  Save me, O God: * for the waters are come in even unto my soul.<br />
<span class="w">68:3</span>  I stick fast in the mire of the deep: * and there is no sure standing.<br />
<span class="w">68:3</span>  I am come into the depth of the sea: * and a tempest hath overwhelmed me.<br />
<span class="w">68:4</span>  I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse: * my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.<br />
<span class="w">68:5</span>  They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, * who hate me without cause.<br />
<span class="w">68:5</span>  My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: * then did I pay that which I took not away.<br />
<span class="w">68:6</span>  O God, thou knowest my foolishness; * and my offences are not hidden from thee.<br />
<span class="w">68:7</span>  Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, * the Lord of hosts.<br />
<span class="w">68:7</span>  Let them not be confounded on my account, * who seek thee, O God of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">68:8</span>  Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; * shame hath covered my face.<br />
<span class="w">68:9</span>  I am become a stranger to my brethren, * and an alien to the sons of my mother.<br />
<span class="w">68:10</span>  For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: * and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.<br />
<span class="w">68:11</span>  And I covered my soul in fasting: * and it was made a reproach to me.<br />
<span class="w">68:12</span>  And I made haircloth my garment: * and I became a byword to them.<br />
<span class="w">68:13</span>  They that sat in the gate spoke against me: * and they that drank wine made me their song.<br />
<span class="w">68:14</span>  But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; * for the time of thy good pleasure, O God.<br />
<span class="w">68:14</span>  In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, * in the truth of thy salvation.<br />
<span class="w">68:15</span>  Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: * deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.<br />
<span class="w">68:16</span>  Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep swallow me up: * and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.<br />
<span class="w">68:17</span>  Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; * look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.<br />
<span class="w">68:18</span>  And turn not away thy face from thy servant: * for I am in trouble, hear me speedily.<br />
<span class="w">68:19</span>  Attend to my soul, and deliver it: * save me because of my enemies.<br />
<span class="w">68:20</span>  Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, * and my shame.<br />
<span class="w">68:21</span>  In thy sight are all they that afflict me; * my heart hath expected reproach and misery.<br />
<span class="w">68:21</span>  And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, * but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none.<br />
<span class="w">68:22</span>  And they gave me gall for my food, * and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<br />
<span class="w">68:23</span>  Let their table become as a snare before them, * and a recompense, and a stumblingblock.<br />
<span class="w">68:24</span>  Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; * and their back bend thou down always.<br />
<span class="w">68:25</span>  Pour out thy indignation upon them: * and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.<br />
<span class="w">68:26</span>  Let their habitation be made desolate: * and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.<br />
<span class="w">68:27</span>  Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; * and they have added to the grief of my wounds.<br />
<span class="w">68:28</span>  Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: * and let them not come into thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">68:29</span>  Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; * and with the just let them not be written.<br />
<span class="w">68:30</span>  I am poor and sorrowful: * thy salvation, O God, hath set me up.<br />
<span class="w">68:31</span>  I will praise the name of God with a canticle: * and I will magnify him with praise.<br />
<span class="w">68:32</span>  And it shall please God better than a young calf, * that bringeth forth horns and hoofs.<br />
<span class="w">68:33</span>  Let the poor see and rejoice: * seek ye God, and your soul shall live.<br />
<span class="w">68:34</span>  For the Lord hath heard the poor: * and hath not despised his prisoners.<br />
<span class="w">68:35</span>  Let the heavens and the earth praise him; * the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein.<br />
<span class="w">68:36</span>  For God will save Sion, * and the cities of Juda shall be built up.<br />
<span class="w">68:36</span>  And they shall dwell there, * and acquire it by inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">68:37</span>  And the seed of his servants shall possess it; * and they that love his name shall dwell therein.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Let them be turned backward * and put to confusion that desire my hurt.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 69</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">69:2</span>  O God, come to my assistance; * O Lord, make haste to help me.<br />
<span class="w">69:3</span>  Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek my soul:<br />
<span class="w">69:4</span>  Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame * that desire evils to me:<br />
<span class="w">69:4</span>  Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame * that say to me: ’T is well, ’t is well.<br />
<span class="w">69:5</span>  Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; * and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.<br />
<span class="w">69:6</span>  But I am needy and poor; * O God, help me.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 70</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">70:1</span>  In thee, O Lord, I have hoped, let me never be put to confusion: * deliver me in thy justice, and rescue me.<br />
<span class="w">70:2</span>  Incline thy ear unto me, * and save me.<br />
<span class="w">70:3</span>  Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a place of strength: * that thou mayst make me safe.<br />
<span class="w">70:3</span>  For thou art my firmament * and my refuge.<br />
<span class="w">70:4</span>  Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, * and out of the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust.<br />
<span class="w">70:5</span>  For thou art my patience, O Lord: * my hope, O Lord, from my youth.<br />
<span class="w">70:6</span>  By thee have I been confirmed from the womb: * from my mother’s womb thou art my protector.<br />
<span class="w">70:7</span>  Of thee shall I continually sing: * I am become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper.<br />
<span class="w">70:8</span>  Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; * thy greatness all the day long.<br />
<span class="w">70:9</span>  Cast me not off in the time of old age: * when my strength shall fail, do not thou forsake me.<br />
<span class="w">70:10</span>  For my enemies have spoken against me; * and they that watched my soul have consulted together,<br />
<span class="w">70:11</span>  Saying: God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, * for there is none to deliver him.<br />
<span class="w">70:12</span>  O God, be not thou far from me: * O my God, make haste to my help.<br />
<span class="w">70:13</span>  Let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul; * let them be covered with confusion and shame that seek my hurt.<br />
<span class="w">70:14</span>  But I will always hope; * and will add to all thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">70:15</span>  My mouth shall shew forth thy justice; * thy salvation all the day long.<br />
<span class="w">70:16</span>  Because I have not known learning, I will enter into the powers of the Lord: * O Lord, I will be mindful of thy justice alone.<br />
<span class="w">70:17</span>  Thou hast taught me, O God, from my youth: * and till now I will declare thy wonderful works.<br />
<span class="w">70:18</span>  And unto old age and grey hairs: * O God, forsake me not,<br />
<span class="w">70:18</span>  Until I shew forth thy arm * to all the generation that is to come:<br />
<span class="w">70:19</span>  Thy power, and thy justice, O God, even to the highest great things thou hast done: * O God, who is like to thee?<br />
<span class="w">70:20</span>  How great troubles hast thou shewn me, many and grievous: and turning thou hast brought me to life, * and hast brought me back again from the depths of the earth:<br />
<span class="w">70:21</span>  Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence; * and turning to me thou hast comforted me.<br />
<span class="w">70:22</span>  For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments of psaltery: * O God, I will sing to thee with the harp,<br />
<span class="w">70:23</span>  My lips shall greatly rejoice, when I shall sing to thee; * and my soul which thou hast redeemed.<br />
<span class="w">70:24</span>  Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day; * when they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me.<br />

Lesson from the book of Lamentations<br />
<span class="ri">Lam 1:1-5</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> Aleph. How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people! how is the mistress of the Gentiles become as a widow: the princes of provinces made tributary!<br />
<span class="w">2</span> Beth. Weeping she hath wept in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: there is none to comfort her among all them that were dear to her: all her friends have despised her, and are become her enemies.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> Ghimel. Juda hath removed her dwelling place because of her affliction, and the greatness of her bondage: she hath dwelt among the nations, and she hath found no rest: all her persecutors have taken her in the midst of straits.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> Daleth. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the solemn feast: all her gates are broken down: her priests sigh: her virgins are in affliction, and she is oppressed with bitterness.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> He. Her adversaries are become her lords, her enemies are enriched: because the Lord hath spoken against her for the multitude of her iniquities: her children are led into captivity: before the face of the oppressor.<br />
<b>J</b>erusalem, Jerusalem, return to the Lord thy God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> At the Mount of Olives He prayed unto the Father: O My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me!<br />
* The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.<br />
 <br />
<b>Reading 2</b><br />
<span class="ri">Lam 1:6-9</span><br />
<span class="w">6</span> Vau. And from the daughter of Sion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like rams that find no pastures: and they are gone away without strength before the face of the pursuer.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> Zain. Jerusalem hath remembered the days of her affliction, and prevarication of all her desirable things which she had from the days of old, when her people fell in the enemy's hand, and there was no helper: the enemies have seen her, and have mocked at her sabbaths.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> Heth. Jerusalem hath grievously sinned, therefore is she become unstable: all that honoured her have despised her, because they have seen her shame: but she sighed and turned backward.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> Teth. Her filthiness is on her feet, and she hath not remembered her end: she is wonderfully cast down, not having a comforter: behold, O Lord, my affliction, because the enemy is lifted up.<br />
<b>J</b>erusalem, Jerusalem, return to the Lord thy God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> My Soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here and watch with me<br />
* Yet a little while, and ye shall see the multitude close Me in. Ye shall flee; and I will go to be offered a sacrifice for you.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Ye shall flee; and I will go to be offered a sacrifice for you.<br />
 <br />
<b>Reading 3</b><br />
<span class="ri">Lam 1:10-14</span><br />
<span class="w">10</span> Jod. The enemy hath put out his hand to all her desirable things: for she hath seen the Gentiles enter into her sanctuary, of whom thou gavest commandment that they should not enter into thy church.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> Caph. All her people sigh, they seek bread: they have given all their precious things for food to relieve the soul: see, O Lord, and consider, for I am become vile.<br />
<span class="w">12</span> Lamed. O all ye that pass by the way, attend, and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow: for he hath made a vintage of me, as the Lord spoke in the day of his fierce anger.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> Mem. From above he hath sent fire into my bones, and hath chastised me: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate, wasted with sorrow all the day long.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> Nun. The yoke of my iniquities hath watched: they are folded together in his hand, and put upon my neck: my strength is weakened: the Lord hath delivered me into a hand out of which I am not able to rise.<br />
<b>J</b>erusalem, Jerusalem, return to the Lord thy God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Behold, when we shall see Him, He hath no form nor comeliness: there is no beauty in Him: this is He Which hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; but He was wounded for our transgressions<br />
* And with His stripes we are healed.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord shall deliver * the needy from the strong: the poor also, that hath no helper.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 71</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">71:2</span>  Give to the king thy judgment, O God: * and to the king’s son thy justice:<br />
<span class="w">71:2</span>  To judge thy people with justice, * and thy poor with judgment.<br />
<span class="w">71:3</span>  Let the mountains receive peace for the people: * and the hills justice.<br />
<span class="w">71:4</span>  He shall judge the poor of the people, and he shall save the children of the poor: * and he shall humble the oppressor.<br />
<span class="w">71:5</span>  And he shall continue with the sun, and before the moon, * throughout all generations.<br />
<span class="w">71:6</span>  He shall come down like rain upon the fleece; * and as showers falling gently upon the earth.<br />
<span class="w">71:7</span>  In his days shall justice spring up, and abundance of peace, * till the moon be taken away.<br />
<span class="w">71:8</span>  And he shall rule from sea to sea, * and from the river unto the ends of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">71:9</span>  Before him the Ethiopians shall fall down: * and his enemies shall lick the ground.<br />
<span class="w">71:10</span>  The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents: * the kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring gifts:<br />
<span class="w">71:11</span>  And all kings of the earth shall adore him: * all nations shall serve him.<br />
<span class="w">71:12</span>  For he shall deliver the poor from the mighty: * and the needy that had no helper.<br />
<span class="w">71:13</span>  He shall spare the poor and needy: * and he shall save the souls of the poor.<br />
<span class="w">71:14</span>  He shall redeem their souls from usuries and iniquity: * and their names shall be honourable in his sight.<br />
<span class="w">71:15</span>  And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Arabia, for him they shall always adore: * they shall bless him all the day.<br />
<span class="w">71:16</span>  And there shall be a firmament on the earth on the tops of mountains, above Libanus shall the fruit thereof be exalted: * and they of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">71:17</span>  Let his name be blessed for evermore: * his name continueth before the sun.<br />
<span class="w">71:17</span>  And in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed: * all nations shall magnify him.<br />

<span class="w">72:1</span>  How good is God to Israel, * to them that are of a right heart!<br />
<span class="w">72:2</span>  But my feet were almost moved; * my steps had wellnigh slipped.<br />
<span class="w">72:3</span>  Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, * seeing the prosperity of sinners.<br />
<span class="w">72:4</span>  For there is no regard to their death, * nor is there strength in their stripes.<br />
<span class="w">72:5</span>  They are not in the labour of men: * neither shall they be scourged like other men.<br />
<span class="w">72:6</span>  Therefore pride hath held them fast: * they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness.<br />
<span class="w">72:7</span>  Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: * they have passed into the affection of the heart.<br />
<span class="w">72:8</span>  They have thought and spoken wickedness: * they have spoken iniquity on high.<br />
<span class="w">72:9</span>  They have set their mouth against heaven: * and their tongue hath passed through the earth.<br />
<span class="w">72:10</span>  Therefore will my people return here * and full days shall be found in them.<br />

<span class="w">72:12</span>  Behold these are sinners; and yet abounding in the world * they have obtained riches.<br />
<span class="w">72:13</span>  And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, * and washed my hands among the innocent.<br />
<span class="w">72:14</span>  And I have been scourged all the day; * and my chastisement hath been in the mornings.<br />
<span class="w">72:15</span>  If I said: I will speak thus; * behold I should condemn the generation of thy children.<br />
<span class="w">72:16</span>  I studied that I might know this thing, * it is a labour in my sight:<br />
<span class="w">72:17</span>  Until I go into the sanctuary of God, * and understand concerning their last ends.<br />
<span class="w">72:18</span>  But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: * when they were lifted up, thou hast cast them down.<br />
<span class="w">72:19</span>  How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: * they have perished by reason of their iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">72:20</span>  As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; * so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.<br />
<span class="w">72:21</span>  For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed: * and I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.<br />
<span class="w">72:23</span>  I am become as a beast before thee: * and I am always with thee.<br />
<span class="w">72:24</span>  Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, * and with thy glory thou hast received me.<br />
<span class="w">72:25</span>  For what have I in heaven? * and besides thee what do I desire upon earth?<br />
<span class="w">72:26</span>  For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: * thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.<br />
<span class="w">72:27</span>  For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: * thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.<br />
<span class="w">72:28</span>  But it is good for me to adhere to my God, * to put my hope in the Lord God:<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 73</span><em> [6]</em><br />

<span class="w">73:2</span>  Remember thy congregation, * which thou hast possessed from the beginning.<br />
<span class="w">73:2</span>  The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: * mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.<br />
<span class="w">73:3</span>  Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; * see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.<br />
<span class="w">73:4</span>  And they that hate thee have made their boasts, * in the midst of thy solemnity.<br />
<span class="w">73:5</span>  They have set up their ensigns for signs, * and they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top.<br />
<span class="w">73:6</span>  As with axes in a wood of trees, they have cut down at once the gates thereof, * with axe and hatchet they have brought it down.<br />

From the Treatise of St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo) Upon the Psalms<br />
<span class="ri">On Psalm liv, 1</span><br />
Give ear to my prayer, O God, and despise not my supplication: attend unto me and hear me. These are the words of a man travailing, anxious, and troubled. He prayeth in the midst of much suffering, longing to be rid of his affliction. Our part is to see what that his affliction was, and when he hath told us, to acknowledge that we also suffer therefrom; that so, partaking in his trouble, we may take part also in his exercise, and am troubled. Wherein mourned he? Wherein was he troubled? He saith: In my exercise. In the next words he giveth us to know that his affliction was the oppression of the wicked, because of the voice of the enemy, and because of the oppression of the wicked, and this suffering which came upon him at the hands of wicked men, he hath called his exercise. Think not that wicked men are in this world for nothing, or that God doth no good with them. Every wicked man liveth, either to repent, or to exercise the righteous.<br />

Would to God that they which now exercise us were converted and exercised with us! Yet, while they are as they are, and exercise us, we will not hate them: for we know not of any one of them whether he will endure to the end in his sin. Yea, oftentimes, when thou deemest that thou hatest thine enemy, he whom thou hatest is thy brother, and thou knowest it not. The Holy Scriptures show us that the devil and his angels are already damned unto everlasting fire, and therefore of their repentance it behoveth us to despair; but of theirs only. These are they against whom we wrestle within; to the which wrestling the Apostle stirreth us up where he saith: We wrestle not against flesh and blood, (that is, not against men whom we see,) but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world. <span class="w">Eph. vi. 12.</span> He saith not the rulers of this world, lest perchance thou shouldest deem that devils are the lords of heaven and earth; what he doth say is, rulers of the darkness of this world, of that world which they love who love the world, of that world wherein the ungodly and unrighteous do prosper, of that world, in fine, of which the Gospel saith: And the world knew Him not.<br />

We have seen iniquity and strife in the city. <span class="w">v. 10.</span> Behold, the glory of the Cross. That Cross which was the object of the insults of God's enemies, is established now above the brows of kings. The end hath shown the measure of its power: it hath conquered the world, not by the sword, but by its wood. The enemies of God thought the Cross a meet object of insult and ridicule, yea, they stood before it, wagging their heads and saying: If He be the Son of God, let Him come down from the Cross! <span class="w">Matth. xxvii. 39, 40.</span> And He stretched forth His Hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. <span class="w">Rom. x. 21.</span> If he is just which liveth by faith, <span class="w">Rom. i. 17; Hab. ii. 4,</span> he is unjust that hath not faith. Therefore where is written iniquity we may understand unbelief. The Lord therefore saith that He saw iniquity and strife in the city, and that He stretched forth His Hands unto that disobedient and gainsaying people, and, disobedient and gainsaying as they were, He was hungry for their salvation, and said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. <span class="w">Luke xxiii. 34.</span><br />

<span class="ri">1 Cor 11:17-22</span><br />
<span class="w">17</span> Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I believe it.<br />
<span class="w">19</span> For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you.<br />
<span class="w">20</span> When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord's supper.<br />
<span class="w">21</span> For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.<br />
<span class="w">22</span> What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.<br />

<span class="w">24</span> And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.<br />
<span class="w">25</span> In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.<br />
<span class="w">26</span> For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall show the death of the Lord, until he come.<br />
