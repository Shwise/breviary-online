<span class="w">2:3</span>  Let us break their bonds asunder: * and let us cast away their yoke from us.<br />

<span class="w">21:2</span>  O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? * Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.<br />
<span class="w">21:3</span>  O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: * and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.<br />
<span class="w">21:4</span>  But thou dwellest in the holy place, * the praise of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">21:5</span>  In thee have our fathers hoped: * they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them.<br />
<span class="w">21:6</span>  They cried to thee, and they were saved: * they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<br />

<span class="w">21:17</span>  For many dogs have encompassed me: * the council of the malignant hath besieged me.<br />
<span class="w">21:17</span>  They have dug my hands and feet. * They have numbered all my bones.<br />

Lesson from the book of Lamentations<br />
<span class="ri">Lam 2:8-11</span><br />
<span class="w">8</span> Heth. The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Sion: he hath stretched out his line, and hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: and the bulwark hath mourned, and the wall hath been destroyed together.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> Teth. Her gates are sunk into the ground: he hath destroyed, and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more, and her prophets have found no vision from the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> Jod. The ancients of the daughter of Sion sit upon the ground, they have held their peace: they have sprinkled their heads with dust, they are girded with haircloth, the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> Caph. My eyes have failed with weeping, my bowels are troubled: my liver is poured out upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people, when the children, and the sucklings, fainted away in the streets of the city.<br />
<b>J</b>erusalem! Jerusalem! Return unto the Lord thy God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> All my friends have forsaken me, and mine enemies have prevailed against me; he whom I loved hath betrayed me.<br />
* Mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me; he breaketh me with breach upon breach: and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> I am numbered with the transgressors; and my life is not spared.<br />

<span class="w">13</span> Mem. To what shall I compare thee? or to what shall I liken thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? to what shall I equal thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Sion? for great as the sea is thy destruction: who shall heal thee?<br />
<span class="w">14</span> Nun. thy prophets have seen false and foolish things for thee: and they have not laid open thy iniquity, to excite thee to penance: but they have seen for thee false revelations and banishments.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Samech. All they that passed by the way have clapped their hands at thee: they have hissed, and wagged their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying: Is this the city of perfect beauty, the joy of all the earth?<br />
<b>J</b>erusalem! Jerusalem! Return unto the Lord thy God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The veil of the Temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom,<br />
* And all the earth did quake: the thief on the cross cried, saying: Lord, remember me when Thou comest into thy kingdom!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The rocks rent, and the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints, which slept, arose.<br />

From the Treatise of St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo,</span> Upon the Psalms<br />
<span class="ri">On Psalm lxiii, 2</span><br />
Thou hast hidden me from the secret counsel of the wicked, from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity. Now let us fix our eyes upon our Head. Many martyrs have. suffered such things as He suffered, but God's hiding of His suffering servants is not so well seen in the Martyrs, as it is in the Captain of the Martyrs. And it is in Him that we best see how it fared with them. He was hidden from the secret counsel of the wicked; hidden by God, being Himself God; hidden, as touching the Manhood, by God the Son, and the very Manhood, Which is taken into God the Son; because He is the Son of man, and He is the Son of God; Son of God, as being in the form of God; Son of man, as having taken upon Him the form of a servant, <span class="w">Phil. ii. 6, 7,</span> Whose life no man taketh from Him, but Who layeth it down of Himself. He hath power to lay it down, and He hath power to take it again, <span class="w">John x. 18.</span> What then was all that they which hated Him could do? They could kill the Body, but they were not able to kill the Soul. Consider this very earnestly. It had been a small thing for the Lord to preach to the Martyrs by His word, if He had not also nerved them by His example.<br />

We know what secret counsel was that of the wicked Jews, and what insurrection was that of the workers of iniquity. Of what iniquity were they the workers? The murder of our Lord Jesus Christ. Many good works, saith He, have I showed you for which of those works go ye about to kill Me? He had borne with all their weaknesses: He had healed all their diseases: He had preached unto them the kingdom of heaven: He had discovered to them their iniquities, that they might rather hate them, than the Physician That came to cure them. And now at last, without gratitude for all the tenderness of His healing love, like men raging in an high delirium, throwing themselves madly on the Physician, Who had come to cure them, they took counsel together how they might kill Him, as if to see if He were a Man and could die, or Something more than a man, and That would not let Himself die. In the Wisdom of Solomon we recognize their words, <span class="w">ii. 18, 19, 20,</span> Let us condemn Him with a shameful death. Let us examine Him; for, by His own saying, He shall be respected. If He be the Son of God, let Him help Him.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Jews crucified Jesus: and there was darkness (over all the land, unto the ninth hour): and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, (saying): My God, (My God,) why hast Thou forsaken Me?<br />
* And He bowed His Head, and gave up the Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> When Jesus had cried with a loud voice, He said: Father, into thy hands I commend My Spirit.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And He bowed His Head, and gave up the Ghost.<br />

They whetted their tongue like a sword. The Jews cannot say: We did not murder Christ, albeit they gave Him over to Pilate His judge, that they themselves might seem free of His death. For when Pilate said unto them, Take ye Him: and kill Him, they answered, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death. They could throw the blame of their sin upon a human judge: but did they deceive God, the Great Judge? In that which Pilate did, he was their accomplice, but in comparison with them, he had far the lesser sin. <span class="w">John xix. 11.</span> Pilate strove as far as he could, to deliver Him out of their hands; for the which reason also he scourged Him, <span class="w">John xix. 1,</span> and brought Him forth to them He scourged not the Lord for cruelty's sake, but in the hope that; he might so slake their wild thirst for blood: that, perchance, even they might be touched with compassion, and cease to lust for His death, when they saw What He was after the flagellation. Even this effort he made! But when Pilate saw that he could not prevail, but that rather a tumult was made, <span class="w">Matth. xxvii. 24,</span> ye know how that he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this Just Person. And yet he delivered Him to be crucified! But if he were guilty who did it against his will, were they innocent; who goaded him on to it? No. Pilate gave sentence against Him. and commanded Him to be crucified. But ye, O ye Jews, ye also are His murderers! Wherewith? With your tongue, whetted like a sword. And when? But when ye cried, Crucify Him! Crucify Him! <span class="w">Mark xv.13-14</span><br />
