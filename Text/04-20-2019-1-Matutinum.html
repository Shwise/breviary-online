<span class="ri">Lam 3:22-30</span><br />
<span class="w">22</span> Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because his commiserations have not failed.<br />
<span class="w">23</span> Heth. They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.<br />

<span class="w">25</span> Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him.<br />
<span class="w">26</span> Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God.<br />
<span class="w">27</span> Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his youth.<br />
<span class="w">28</span> Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath taken it up upon himself.<br />
<span class="w">29</span> Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.<br />

<span class="w">2</span> Beth. The noble sons of Sion, and they that were clothed with the best gold: how are they esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of the potter's hands?<br />
<span class="w">3</span> Ghimel. Even the sea monsters have drawn out the breast, they have given suck to their young: the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostrich in the desert.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> Daleth. The tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> He. They that were fed delicately have died in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet have embraced the dung.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> Vau. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is made greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took nothing in her.<br />

<span class="w">8</span> Servants have ruled over us: there was none to redeem us out of their hand.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> We fetched our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the desert.<br />

From the Treatise of St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo,</span> Upon the Psalms<br />
<span class="ri">On Psalm lxiii, 7</span><br />
We shall attain to thoughts that are very deep: but God shall still be exalted. The enemies of our Lord had communed of laying snares privily; they had said, Who shall see them? They had searched out iniquities; they had accomplished a diligent search. And Man attained even unto (the realization of) their counsels, for the Lord, as Man, suffered Himself to be taken. For He had not been taken at all, unless He had been a Man, or seen, unless He had been a Man, or smitten, unless He had been a Man, or crucified, unless He had been a Man, or have died, unless He had been a Man. Man therefore, He attained unto all those sufferings, which had had nothing in Him, unless He had been a Man. But if He had not been Man, man had not been redeemed. And the Lord as Man attained to thoughts that were very deep, yea, secret; showing the Manhood to the eyes of men, and keeping the Godhead within Him; veiling the form of God, as touching Which, He is Equal to the Father, and manifesting the form of a servant, as touching which, He is inferior to the Father.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Our Shepherd, even the Fountain of living waters, is gone from us; He passed away, and the sun was darkened.<br />
* For now hath our Saviour bound him captive, which bound the first man captive; this day hath He burst the gates and bars of death.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The bands of hell He hath utterly abolished, and hath done away the power of the devil.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For now hath our Saviour bound him captive, which bound the first man captive; this day hath He burst the gates and bars of death.<br />
 <br />
<b>Reading 5</b><br />
How far did the accomplishment of their diligent search reach? Even to the setting a watch of soldiers at the sepulchre, to guard the Lord, even after He was dead and buried. For they said unto Pilate: Sir, we remember that that deceiver <span class="w">Matth. xxvii. 63.</span> This was the term by which they designated the Lord Jesus Christ, and the remembrance that He was so named is a sweet consolation to us His servants, when we are called impostors. So they said unto Pilate, that deceiver said, while He was yet alive: After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest His disciples come and steal Him away, and say unto the people: He is risen again from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them: Ye have a watch; go your way; make it as sure as ye can. So they went and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O all ye that pass by, behold and see;<br />
* If there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow.<br />

So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch and anon, behold, there was a great earthquake, and the Lord arose. So great wonders were wrought about the sepulchre that the very soldiers, which were put to guard it, were witnesses thereto, if only they would have told the truth. But the same love of money which had made a slave of that disciple who was a companion of Christ, made slaves also of the soldiers that were put to watch His sepulchre. Some of the watch came into the city, and showed unto the chief-priests all the things that were done: and when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, saying: Say ye, His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we slept. In good sooth, their diligent search had been accomplished and ended before this. What didst thou say, O stupid cunning? Wast thou indeed so utterly void of the light of godly wisdom, and confounded in the bottomless pit of thine own falsehood as to tell them to say: His disciples came by night, and stole Him away while we slept? Part of the testimony of thine eye-witnesses was that they were asleep at the time: thou thyself wast asleep not to be able to see that on their own testimony, their testimony must have been worthless.<br />

<span class="w">87:2</span>  Lord, the God of my salvation: * I have cried in the day, and in the night before thee.<br />
<span class="w">87:3</span>  Let my prayer come in before thee: * incline thy ear to my petition.<br />

<span class="w">87:9</span>  Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me: * they have set me an abomination to themselves.<br />

From the letter of blessed Apostle Paul to the Hebrews<br />
<span class="ri">Heb 9:11-14</span><br />
<span class="w">11</span> But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:<br />
<span class="w">12</span> Neither by the blood of goats, or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the holies, having obtained eternal redemption.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh:<br />
<span class="w">14</span> How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together<br />
* Against the Lord, and against His Anointed.<br />

<span class="ri">Heb 9:15-18</span><br />
<span class="w">15</span> And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his death, for the redemption of those transgressions, which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> For where there is a testament, the death of the testator must of necessity come in.<br />
<span class="w">17</span> For a testament is of force, after men are dead: otherwise it is as yet of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I am counted with them that go down into the pit.<br />
* I am as a man that hath no strength, lying nerveless among the dead.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> They have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, and in the shadow of death.<br />

<b>Reading 9</b><br />
<span class="ri">Heb 9:19-22</span><br />
<span class="w">19</span> For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,<br />
<span class="w">20</span> Saying: This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined unto you.<br />
<span class="w">21</span> The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.<br />
