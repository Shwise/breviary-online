<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O death, I will be thy death; * O grave, I will be thy destruction.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 50</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.<br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">50:13</span>  Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br />
<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />
<span class="w">50:15</span>  I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.<br />
<span class="w">50:16</span>  Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O death, I will be thy death; O grave, I will be thy destruction.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 91</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">91:2</span>  It is good to give praise to the Lord: * and to sing to thy name, O most High.<br />
<span class="w">91:3</span>  To shew forth thy mercy in the morning, * and thy truth in the night:<br />
<span class="w">91:4</span>  Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery: * with a canticle upon the harp.<br />
<span class="w">91:5</span>  For thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in thy doings: * and in the works of thy hands I shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">91:6</span>  O Lord, how great are thy works! * thy thoughts are exceeding deep.<br />
<span class="w">91:7</span>  The senseless man shall not know: * nor will the fool understand these things.<br />
<span class="w">91:8</span>  When the wicked shall spring up as grass: * and all the workers of iniquity shall appear:<br />
<span class="w">91:9</span>  That they may perish for ever and ever: * but thou, O Lord, art most high for evermore.<br />
<span class="w">91:10</span>  For behold thy enemies, O Lord, for behold thy enemies shall perish: * and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.<br />
<span class="w">91:11</span>  But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn: * and my old age in plentiful mercy.<br />
<span class="w">91:12</span>  My eye also hath looked down upon my enemies: * and my ear shall hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me.<br />
<span class="w">91:13</span>  The just shall flourish like the palm tree: * he shall grow up like the cedar of Libanus.<br />
<span class="w">91:14</span>  They that are planted in the house of the Lord * shall flourish in the courts of the house of our God.<br />
<span class="w">91:15</span>  They shall still increase in a fruitful old age: * and shall be well treated, that they may shew,<br />
<span class="w">91:16</span>  That the Lord our God is righteous, * and there is no iniquity in him.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O all ye nations, behold * and see my sorrow.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 63</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">63:2</span>  Hear, O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee: * deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.<br />
<span class="w">63:3</span>  Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; * from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">63:4</span>  For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; * they have bent their bow a bitter thing, to shoot in secret the undefiled.<br />
<span class="w">63:6</span>  They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: * they are resolute in wickedness.<br />
<span class="w">63:6</span>  They have talked of hiding snares; * they have said: Who shall see them?<br />
<span class="w">63:7</span>  They have searched after iniquities: * they have failed in their search.<br />
<span class="w">63:7</span>  Man shall come to a deep heart: * and God shall be exalted.<br />
<span class="w">63:8</span>  The arrows of children are their wounds: * and their tongues against them are made weak.<br />
<span class="w">63:9</span>  All that saw them were troubled; * and every man was afraid.<br />
<span class="w">63:10</span>  And they declared the works of God: * and understood his doings.<br />
<span class="w">63:11</span>  The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: * and all the upright in heart shall be praised.<br />
<span class="w">omit Glory be</span><br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O all ye nations, behold and see my sorrow.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, deliver my soul * from the gates of the grave.<br />
<span class="ri">Canticle of Ezechias</span><em> [4]</em><br />
 <span class="w">(Canticle of Ezechias * Isa 38:10-23)</span> <br />
<span class="w">38:10</span>  I said: In the midst of my days * I shall go to the gates of hell:<br />
<span class="w">38:11</span>  I sought for the residue of my years. * I said: I shall not see the Lord God in the land of the living.<br />
<span class="w">38:12</span>  I shall behold man no more, * nor the inhabitant of rest.<br />
<span class="w">38:13</span>  My generation is at an end, and it is rolled away from me, * as a shepherd’s tent.<br />
<span class="w">38:14</span>  My life is cut off, as by a weaver: whilst I was yet but beginning, he cut me off: * from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me.<br />
<span class="w">38:15</span>  I hoped till morning, * as a lion so hath he broken all my bones:<br />
<span class="w">38:16</span>  From morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me. * I will cry like a young swallow, I will meditate like a dove:<br />
<span class="w">38:17</span>  My eyes are weakened * looking upward:<br />
<span class="w">38:18</span>  Lord, I suffer violence, answer thou for me. * What shall I say, or what shall he answer for me, whereas he himself hath done it?<br />
<span class="w">38:19</span>  I will recount to thee all my years * in the bitterness of my soul.<br />
<span class="w">38:20</span>  O Lord, if man’s life be such, and the life of my spirit be in such things as these, thou shalt correct me, and make me to live. * Behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter:<br />
<span class="w">38:21</span>  But thou hast delivered my soul that it should not perish, * thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.<br />
<span class="w">38:22</span>  For hell shall not confess to thee, neither shall death praise thee: * nor shall they that go down into the pit, look for thy truth.<br />
<span class="w">38:23</span>  The living, the living, he shall give praise to thee, as I do this day: * the father shall make thy truth known to the children.<br />
<span class="w">38:24</span>  O Lord, save me, and we will sing our psalms all the days of our life * in the house of the Lord.<br />

<span class="w">150:2</span>  Praise ye him for his mighty acts: * praise ye him according to the multitude of his greatness.<br />
