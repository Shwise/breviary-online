<span class="w">113:5</span>  What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: * and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?<br />
<span class="w">113:6</span>  Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, * and ye hills, like lambs of the flock?<br />
<span class="w">113:7</span>  At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, * at the presence of the God of Jacob:<br />
<span class="w">113:8</span>  Who turned the rock into pools of water, * and the stony hill into fountains of waters.<br />
<span class="w">113:9</span>  Not to us, O Lord, not to us; * but to thy name give glory.<br />
<span class="w">113:10</span>  For thy mercy, and for thy truthâ€™s sake: * lest the Gentiles should say: Where is their God?<br />
<span class="w">113:11</span>  But our God is in heaven: * he hath done all things whatsoever he would.<br />
<span class="w">113:12</span>  The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, * the works of the hands of men.<br />
<span class="w">113:13</span>  They have mouths and speak not: * they have eyes and see not.<br />
<span class="w">113:14</span>  They have ears and hear not: * they have noses and smell not.<br />
<span class="w">113:15</span>  They have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not: * neither shall they cry out through their throat.<br />
<span class="w">113:16</span>  Let them that make them become like unto them: * and all such as trust in them.<br />
<span class="w">113:17</span>  The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord: * he is their helper and their protector.<br />
<span class="w">113:18</span>  The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord: * he is their helper and their protector.<br />
<span class="w">113:19</span>  They that fear the Lord have hoped in the Lord: * he is their helper and their protector.<br />
<span class="w">113:20</span>  The Lord hath been mindful of us, * and hath blessed us.<br />
<span class="w">113:20</span>  He hath blessed the house of Israel: * he hath blessed the house of Aaron.<br />

<span class="w">113:23</span>  Blessed be you of the Lord, * who made heaven and earth.<br />
<span class="w">113:24</span>  The heaven of heaven is the Lordâ€™s: * but the earth he has given to the children of men.<br />
<span class="w">113:25</span>  The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord: * nor any of them that go down to hell.<br />
<span class="w">113:26</span>  But we that live bless the Lord: * from this time now and for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
