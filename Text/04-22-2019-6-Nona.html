<span class="ri">Psalm 118(129-144)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">118:129</span>  <span class="w">(Phe)</span> Thy testimonies are wonderful: * therefore my soul hath sought them.<br />
<span class="w">118:130</span>  The declaration of thy words giveth light: * and giveth understanding to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">118:131</span>  I opened my mouth, and panted: * because I longed for thy commandments.<br />
<span class="w">118:132</span>  Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me, * according to the judgment of them that love thy name.<br />
<span class="w">118:133</span>  Direct my steps according to thy word: * and let no iniquity have dominion over me.<br />
<span class="w">118:134</span>  Redeem me from the calumnies of men: * that I may keep thy commandments.<br />
<span class="w">118:135</span>  Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: * and teach me thy justifications.<br />
<span class="w">118:136</span>  My eyes have sent forth springs of water: * because they have not kept thy law.<br />
<span class="w">118:137</span>  <span class="w">(Sade)</span> Thou art just, O Lord: * and thy judgment is right.<br />
<span class="w">118:138</span>  Thou hast commanded justice thy testimonies: * and thy truth exceedingly.<br />
<span class="w">118:139</span>  My zeal hath made me pine away: * because my enemies forgot thy words.<br />
<span class="w">118:140</span>  Thy word is exceedingly refined: * and thy servant hath loved it.<br />
<span class="w">118:141</span>  I am very young and despised; but * I forget not thy justifications.<br />
<span class="w">118:142</span>  Thy justice is justice for ever: * and thy law is the truth.<br />
<span class="w">118:143</span>  Trouble and anguish have found me: * thy commandments are my meditation.<br />
<span class="w">118:144</span>  Thy testimonies are justice for ever: * give me understanding, and I shall live.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 118(145-160)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">118:145</span>  <span class="w">(Coph)</span> I cried with my whole heart, hear me, O Lord: * I will seek thy justifications.<br />
<span class="w">118:146</span>  I cried unto thee, save me: * that I may keep thy commandments.<br />
<span class="w">118:147</span>  I prevented the dawning of the day, and cried: * because in thy words I very much hoped.<br />
<span class="w">118:148</span>  My eyes to thee have prevented the morning: * that I might meditate on thy words.<br />
<span class="w">118:149</span>  Hear thou my voice, O Lord, according to thy mercy: * and quicken me according to thy judgment.<br />
<span class="w">118:150</span>  They that persecute me have drawn nigh to iniquity; * but they are gone far off from thy law.<br />
<span class="w">118:151</span>  Thou art near, O Lord: * and all thy ways are truth.<br />
<span class="w">118:152</span>  I have known from the beginning concerning thy testimonies: * that thou hast founded them for ever.<br />
<span class="w">118:153</span>  <span class="w">(Res)</span> See my humiliation and deliver me: * for I have not forgotten thy law.<br />
<span class="w">118:154</span>  Judge my judgment and redeem me: * quicken thou me for thy word’s sake.<br />
<span class="w">118:155</span>  Salvation is far from sinners; * because they have not sought thy justifications.<br />
<span class="w">118:156</span>  Many, O Lord, are thy mercies: * quicken me according to thy judgment.<br />
<span class="w">118:157</span>  Many are they that persecute me, and afflict me; * but I have not declined from thy testimonies.<br />
<span class="w">118:158</span>  I beheld the transgressors, and I pined away; * because they kept not thy word.<br />
<span class="w">118:159</span>  Behold I have loved thy commandments, O Lord; * quicken me thou in thy mercy.<br />
<span class="w">118:160</span>  The beginning of thy words is truth: * all the judgments of thy justice are for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 118(161-176)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">118:161</span>  <span class="w">(Sin)</span> Princes have persecuted me without cause: * and my heart hath been in awe of thy words.<br />
<span class="w">118:162</span>  I will rejoice at thy words, * as one that hath found great spoil.<br />
<span class="w">118:163</span>  I have hated and abhorred iniquity; * but I have loved thy law.<br />
<span class="w">118:164</span>  Seven times a day I have given praise to thee, * for the judgments of thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">118:165</span>  Much peace have they that love thy law, * and to them there is no stumbling-block.<br />
<span class="w">118:166</span>  I looked for thy salvation, O Lord: * and I loved thy commandments.<br />
<span class="w">118:167</span>  My soul hath kept thy testimonies: * and hath loved them exceedingly.<br />
<span class="w">118:168</span>  I have kept thy commandments and thy testimonies: * because all my ways are in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">118:169</span>  <span class="w">(Tau)</span> Let my supplication, O Lord, come near in thy sight: * give me understanding according to thy word.<br />
<span class="w">118:170</span>  Let my request come in before thee; * deliver thou me according to thy word.<br />
<span class="w">118:171</span>  My lips shall utter a hymn, * when thou shalt teach me thy justifications.<br />
<span class="w">118:172</span>  My tongue shall pronounce thy word: * because all thy commandments are justice.<br />
<span class="w">118:173</span>  Let thy hand be with me to save me; * for I have chosen thy precepts.<br />
<span class="w">118:174</span>  I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord; * and thy law is my meditation.<br />
<span class="w">118:175</span>  My soul shall live and shall praise thee: * and thy judgments shall help me.<br />
<span class="w">118:176</span>  I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost: * seek thy servant, because I have not forgotten thy commandments.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
