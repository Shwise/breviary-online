<i class="a">O</i> God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world cannot give, so that, with our hearts set to obey thy commandments, and freed from the fear of the enemy, we may pass our lives in peace under thy protection.<br />
<i class="a">I</i>nflame our hearts and our desires, O Lord, with the fire of the Holy Spirit, so that we may serve thee with a chaste body, and please thee with a pure heart.<br />
<i class="a">O</i> God, thou art the creator and redeemer of all the faithful. Grant to the souls of thy servants departed the remission of all their sins, so that by our faithful prayers they may obtain the pardon they have always desired.<br />
<i class="a">W</i>e beg thee, O Lord, to direct our actions by thy holy inspiration, and carry them forward by thy gracious assistance, so that every prayer and work of ours may always begin with thee, and, begun through thee, be happily ended.<br />
<i class="a">A</i>lmighty and everlasting God, who hast dominion over the living and the dead and who art merciful to all whom thou foreknowest shall be thine by faith and good works, we humbly beg of thee, that they for whom we have intended to pour out our prayers, whether this present world still detains them in the flesh, or whether the world to come has already received them out of their bodies, may, through the prayers of all thy saints, by thy merciful goodness obtain the remission of all their sins.<br />
<b>T</b>hrough Jesus Christ, thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end.<br />
