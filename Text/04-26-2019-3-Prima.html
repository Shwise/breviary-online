<span class="w">53:4</span>  O God, hear my prayer: * give ear to the words of my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">53:5</span>  For strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul: * and they have not set God before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">53:6</span>  For behold God is my helper: * and the Lord is the protector of my soul.<br />
<span class="w">53:7</span>  Turn back the evils upon my enemies; * and cut them off in thy truth.<br />
<span class="w">53:8</span>  I will freely sacrifice to thee, * and will give praise, O God, to thy name: because it is good:<br />
