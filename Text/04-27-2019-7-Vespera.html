<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">A</i>t the Lamb’s high feast we sing<br />
Praise to our victorious King,<br />
Who hath washed us in the tide<br />
Flowing from his piercèd side.<br />
 <br />
Praise we him whose love divine<br />
Gives the guests his blood for wine,<br />
Gives his body for the feast, <br />
Love the victim, love the priest.<br />
 <br />
Where the paschal blood is poured,<br />
Death’s dark angel sheathes his sword;<br />
Israel’s hosts triumphant go <br />
Through the wave that drowns the foe.<br />
 <br />
Christ, the Lamb whose blood was shed,<br />
Paschal victim, paschal bread;<br />
With sincerity and love<br />
Eat we manna from above.<br />
 <br />
Mighty victim from the sky,<br />
Powers of hell beneath thee lie;<br />
Death is conquered in the fight;<br />
Thou hast brought us life and light.<br />
 <br />
Now thy banner thou dost wave;<br />
Vanquished Satan and the grave;<br />
Angels join his praise to tell —<br />
See o’erthrown the prince of hell.<br />
 <br />
Paschal triumph, paschal joy,<br />
Only sin can this destroy;<br />
From the death of sin set free,<br />
Souls re-born, dear Lord, in Thee.<br />

Father, unto thee we raise;<br />
Risen Lord, all praise to thee,<br />
Ever with the Spirit be.<br />
