Doth live and reign eternally.<br />

<span class="w">26:1</span>  The Lord is the protector of my life: * of whom shall I be afraid?<br />
<span class="w">26:2</span>  Whilst the wicked draw near against me, * to eat my flesh.<br />
<span class="w">26:2</span>  My enemies that trouble me, * have themselves been weakened, and have fallen.<br />
<span class="w">26:3</span>  If armies in camp should stand together against me, * my heart shall not fear.<br />
<span class="w">26:3</span>  If a battle should rise up against me, * in this will I be confident.<br />
<span class="w">26:4</span>  One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; * that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.<br />
<span class="w">26:4</span>  That I may see the delight of the Lord, * and may visit his temple.<br />
<span class="w">26:5</span>  For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle; * in the day of evils, he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.<br />
<span class="w">26:6</span>  He hath exalted me upon a rock: * and now he hath lifted up my head above my enemies.<br />
<span class="w">26:6</span>  I have gone round, and have offered up in his tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation: * I will sing, and recite a psalm to the Lord.<br />

<span class="w">26:9</span>  Be thou my helper, * forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O God my Saviour.<br />

<span class="w">27:4</span>  Give them according to their works, * and according to the wickedness of their inventions.<br />
<span class="w">27:4</span>  According to the works of their hands give thou to them: * render to them their reward.<br />
<span class="w">27:5</span>  Because they have not understood the works of the Lord, and the operations of his hands: * thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build them up.<br />
<span class="w">27:6</span>  Blessed be the Lord, * for he hath heard the voice of my supplication.<br />
<span class="w">27:7</span>  The Lord is my helper and my protector: * in him hath my heart confided, and I have been helped.<br />
<span class="w">27:7</span>  And my flesh hath flourished again, * and with my will I will give praise to him.<br />
