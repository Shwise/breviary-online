Glory be henceforth thine through all the ages,<br />
World without ending.<br />

<span class="w">34:1</span>  Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: * overthrow them that fight against me.<br />
<span class="w">34:2</span>  Take hold of arms and shield: * and rise up to help me.<br />
<span class="w">34:3</span>  Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: * say to my soul: I am thy salvation.<br />
<span class="w">34:4</span>  Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek after my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:4</span>  Let them be turned back and be confounded * that devise against me.<br />
<span class="w">34:5</span>  Let them become as dust before the wind: * and let the Angel of the Lord straiten them.<br />
<span class="w">34:6</span>  Let their way become dark and slippery; * and let the Angel of the Lord pursue them.<br />
<span class="w">34:7</span>  For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: * without cause they have upbraided my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:8</span>  Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: * and into that very snare let them fall.<br />
<span class="w">34:9</span>  But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; * and shall be delighted in his salvation.<br />
<span class="w">34:10</span>  All my bones shall say: * Lord, who is like to thee?<br />
<span class="w">34:10</span>  Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; * the needy and the poor from them that strip him.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 34(11-17)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">34:11</span>  Unjust witnesses rising up * have asked me things I knew not.<br />
<span class="w">34:12</span>  They repaid me evil for good: * to the depriving me of my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:13</span>  But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, * I was clothed with haircloth.<br />
<span class="w">34:13</span>  I humbled my soul with fasting; * and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom.<br />
<span class="w">34:14</span>  As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: * as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.<br />
<span class="w">34:15</span>  But they rejoiced against me, and came together: * scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not.<br />
<span class="w">34:16</span>  They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: * they gnashed upon me with their teeth.<br />

<span class="w">34:18</span>  I will give thanks to thee in a great church; * I will praise thee in a strong people.<br />
<span class="w">34:19</span>  Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: * who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">34:20</span>  For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; * and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.<br />
<span class="w">34:21</span>  And they opened their mouth wide against me; * they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.<br />
<span class="w">34:22</span>  Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: * O Lord, depart not from me.<br />
<span class="w">34:23</span>  Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: * to my cause, my God, and my Lord.<br />
<span class="w">34:24</span>  Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, * and let them not rejoice over me.<br />
<span class="w">34:25</span>  Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our mind: * neither let them say: We have swallowed him up.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 36(1-15)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:1</span>  Be not emulous of evildoers; * nor envy them that work iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">36:2</span>  For they shall shortly wither away as grass, * and as the green herbs shall quickly fall.<br />
<span class="w">36:3</span>  Trust in the Lord, and do good, * and dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with its riches.<br />
<span class="w">36:4</span>  Delight in the Lord, * and he will give thee the requests of thy heart.<br />
<span class="w">36:5</span>  Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, * and he will do it.<br />
<span class="w">36:6</span>  And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday: * be subject to the Lord and pray to him.<br />
<span class="w">36:7</span>  Envy not the man who prospereth in his way; * the man who doth unjust things.<br />
<span class="w">36:8</span>  Cease from anger, and leave rage; * have no emulation to do evil.<br />
<span class="w">36:9</span>  For the evildoers shall be cut off: * but they that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the land.<br />
<span class="w">36:10</span>  For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: * and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.<br />
<span class="w">36:11</span>  But the meek shall inherit the land, * and shall delight in abundance of peace.<br />
<span class="w">36:12</span>  The sinner shall watch the just man: * and shall gnash upon him with his teeth.<br />
<span class="w">36:13</span>  But the Lord shall laugh at him: * for he foreseeth that his day shall come.<br />
<span class="w">36:14</span>  The wicked have drawn out the sword: * they have bent their bow.<br />
<span class="w">36:14</span>  To cast down the poor and needy, * to kill the upright of heart.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 36(16-29)</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:16</span>  Better is a little to the just, * than the great riches of the wicked.<br />
<span class="w">36:17</span>  For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; * but the Lord strengtheneth the just.<br />
<span class="w">36:18</span>  The Lord knoweth the days of the undefiled; * and their inheritance shall be for ever.<br />
<span class="w">36:19</span>  They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled, * because the wicked shall perish.<br />
<span class="w">36:20</span>  And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, * shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke.<br />
<span class="w">36:21</span>  The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; * but the just sheweth mercy and shall give.<br />
<span class="w">36:22</span>  For such as bless him shall inherit the land: * but such as curse him shall perish.<br />
<span class="w">36:23</span>  With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, * and he shall like well his way.<br />
<span class="w">36:24</span>  When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, * for the Lord putteth his hand under him.<br />
<span class="w">36:25</span>  I have been young, and now am old; * and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.<br />
<span class="w">36:26</span>  He sheweth mercy, and lendeth all the day long; * and his seed shall be in blessing.<br />
<span class="w">36:27</span>  Decline from evil and do good, * and dwell for ever and ever.<br />
<span class="w">36:28</span>  For the Lord loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints: * they shall be preserved for ever.<br />
<span class="w">36:28</span>  The unjust shall be punished, * and the seed of the wicked shall perish.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 36(30-40)</span><em> [6]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:30</span>  The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom: * and his tongue shall speak judgment.<br />
<span class="w">36:31</span>  The law of his God is in his heart, * and his steps shall not be supplanted.<br />
<span class="w">36:32</span>  The wicked watcheth the just man, * and seeketh to put him to death.<br />
<span class="w">36:33</span>  But the Lord will not leave him in his hands; * nor condemn him when he shall be judged.<br />
<span class="w">36:34</span>  Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: * when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.<br />
<span class="w">36:35</span>  I have seen the wicked highly exalted, * and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus.<br />
<span class="w">36:36</span>  And I passed by, and lo, he was not: * and I sought him and his place was not found.<br />
<span class="w">36:37</span>  Keep innocence, and behold justice: * for there are remnants for the peaceable man.<br />
<span class="w">36:38</span>  But the unjust shall be destroyed together: * the remnants of the wicked shall perish.<br />
<span class="w">36:39</span>  But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, * and he is their protector in the time of trouble.<br />

<span class="w">37:6</span>  My sores are putrified and corrupted, * because of my foolishness.<br />
<span class="w">37:7</span>  I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end: * I walked sorrowful all the day long.<br />
<span class="w">37:8</span>  For my loins are filled with illusions; * and there is no health in my flesh.<br />
<span class="w">37:9</span>  I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: * I roared with the groaning of my heart.<br />

Lesson from the Acts of the Apostles<br />
<span class="ri">Acts 2:1-8</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place:<br />
<span class="w">2</span> And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them:<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these, that speak, Galileans?<br />
<span class="w">8</span> And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born?<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<span class="w">15</span> For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day:<br />
<span class="w">16</span> But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:<br />
<span class="w">17</span> And it shall come to pass, in the last days, <span class="w">saith the Lord,</span> I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy.<br />
<span class="w">19</span> And I will show wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath: blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.<br />
<span class="w">20</span> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord come.<br />
<span class="w">21</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.<br />
<span class="ri">Acts 2:22-27</span><br />
<span class="w">22</span> Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by him, in the midst of you, as you also know:<br />
<span class="w">23</span> This same being delivered up, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and slain.<br />
<span class="w">24</span> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it was impossible that he should be holden by it.<br />
<span class="w">25</span> For David saith concerning him: I foresaw the Lord before my face: because he is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.<br />
<span class="w">26</span> For this my heart hath been glad, and any tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.<br />
<span class="w">27</span> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be new dough: for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us:<br />
* Therefore let us keep the Feast, in the Lord, alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> He died for our offences, and rose again for our justification.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Therefore let us keep the Feast, in the Lord, alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Therefore let us keep the Feast, in the Lord, alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
Catharine, a virgin of Siena, born of devout parents, was granted the habit of St. <br />
Dominic worn by the Sisters of Penance. Her abstinence was most strict, and her whole life was one of marvellous austerity. When she was staying at Pisa on the Lord's Day, refreshed by the Bread of heaven and rapt in ecstasy, she saw the crucified Lord coming with a great light and, from the marks of his wounds, five rays coming down to the same places in her body. Aware of the mystery, she implored the Lord that the wounds would not be visible, and the colour of the rays immediately changed from that of blood to brightness, in the form of pure light touching her hands and feet and heart. But such was the pain she suffered, even though the signs of the bleeding wounds could not be seen, that she believed she would soon have died if God had not lessened it. Her learning was infused, not acquired. She went to Pope Gregory XI at Avignon and shewed him that she knew by divine means of the vow he had made to return to the City, a vow known to God alone, and she was the cause of the Pope's going to occupy in person his See at Rome. In about the thirty-third year of her age she went to her Bridegroom, and Pius II enrolled her among the holy Virgins.<br />
