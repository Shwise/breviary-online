<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> thou, the heavens' eternal King,<br />
Creator, unto thee we sing,<br />
With God the Father ever One,<br />
Co-equal, co-eternal Son.<br />
 <br />
Thy hand, when first the world began,<br />
Made in thine own pure image man,<br />
And linked to Adam, sprung from earth,<br />
A living soul of heavenly birth.<br />
 <br />
And when by craft the envious foe<br />
Had marred thy noblest work below,<br />
Clothed in our flesh, thou didst restore<br />
The image thou hadst made before.<br />
 <br />
Once wast thou born of Mary's womb;<br />
And now, new-born from out the tomb,<br />
O Christ, thou bidd'st us rise with thee<br />
From death to immortality.<br />
 <br />
Eternal Shepherd, thou dost lave<br />
Thy flock in pure baptismal wave,<br />
That mystic bath, that grave of sin,<br />
Where ransomed souls new life begin.<br />
 <br />
Redeemer, thou for us didst deign<br />
To hang upon the Cross of pain,<br />
And give for us the lavish price<br />
Of thine own blood in sacrifice.<br />
 <br />
Grant, Lord, in thee each faithful mind<br />
Unceasing paschal joy may find;<br />
And from the death of sin set free<br />
Souls newly born to life by thee.<br />
 <br />
To thee, once dead, who now dost live,<br />
All glory, Lord, thy people give,<br />
Whom, with the Father, we adore,<br />
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">13:1</span>  The fool hath said in his heart: * there is no God.<br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: * there is none that doth good, no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:2</span>  The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see if there be any that understand and seek God.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: * there is none that doth good: no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: * the poison of asps is under their lips.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; * their feet are swift to shed blood.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Destruction and unhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: * there is no fear of God before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">13:4</span>  Shall not all they know that work iniquity, * who devour my people as they eat bread?<br />
<span class="w">13:5</span>  They have not called upon the Lord: * there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.<br />
<span class="w">13:6</span>  For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man; * but the Lord is his hope.<br />
<span class="w">13:7</span>  Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? * when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.<br />

<span class="w">16:5</span>  Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: * that my footsteps be not moved.<br />
<span class="w">16:6</span>  I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: * O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.<br />
<span class="w">16:7</span>  Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; * thou who savest them that trust in thee.<br />
<span class="w">16:8</span>  From them that resist thy right hand keep me, * as the apple of thy eye.<br />
<span class="w">16:9</span>  Protect me under the shadow of thy wings. * from the face of the wicked who have afflicted me.<br />

<span class="w">16:14</span>  They are full of children: * and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.<br />
<span class="w">16:15</span>  But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: * I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">17:7</span>  In my affliction I called upon the Lord, * and I cried to my God:<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  And he heard my voice from his holy temple: * and my cry before him came into his ears.<br />

<span class="w">17:10</span>  He bowed the heavens, and came down, * and darkness was under his feet.<br />
<span class="w">17:11</span>  And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; * he flew upon the wings of the winds.<br />

<span class="w">17:15</span>  And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: * he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  Then the fountains of waters appeared, * and the foundations of the world were discovered:<br />

Lesson from the Acts of the Apostles<br />
<span class="ri">Acts 15:5-12</span><br />
<span class="w">5</span> But there arose some of the sect of the Pharisees that believed, saying: They must be circumcised, and be commanded to observe the law of Moses.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> And the apostles and ancients assembled to consider of this matter.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> And when there had been much disputing, Peter, rising up, said to them: Men, brethren, you know, that in former days God made choice among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> And God, who knoweth the hearts, gave testimony, giving unto them the Holy Ghost, as well as to us;<br />
<span class="w">9</span> And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> Now therefore, why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?<br />
<span class="w">11</span> But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, in like manner as they also.<br />
<span class="w">12</span> And all the multitude held their peace; and they heard Barnabas and Paul telling what great signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> With great power gave the Apostles<br />
* Witness of the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, alleluia, alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Witness of the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, alleluia, alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Son, the Sole-begotten, mercifully bless and keep us. Amen. <br />

<span class="ri">Acts 15:13-21</span><br />
<span class="w">13</span> And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying: Men, brethren, hear me.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> Simon hath related how God first visited to take of the Gentiles a people to his name.<br />
<span class="w">15</span> And to this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written:<br />
<span class="w">16</span> After these things I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and the ruins thereof I will rebuild, and I will set it up:<br />
<span class="w">17</span> That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all nations upon whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord, who doth these things.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> To the Lord was his own work known from the beginning of the world.<br />
<span class="w">19</span> For which cause I judge that they, who from among the Gentiles are converted to God, are not to be disquieted.<br />
<span class="w">20</span> But that we write unto them, that they refrain themselves from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.<br />
<span class="w">21</span> For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him in the synagogues, where he is read every sabbath.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> From the mouth of the wise doth proceed honey, alleluia: the sweetness of honey is under his tongue, alleluia.<br />
* His lips drop as the honey-comb, alleluia, alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Wisdom doth abide in his heart, and out of his mouth cometh understanding.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> His lips drop as the honey-comb, alleluia, alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> His lips drop as the honey-comb, alleluia, alleluia.<br />

<span class="ri">Acts 15:22-29</span><br />
<span class="w">22</span> Then it pleased the apostles and ancients, with the whole church, to choose men of their own company, and to send to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas, who was surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren.<br />
<span class="w">23</span> Writing by their hands: The apostles and ancients, brethren, to the brethren of the Gentiles that are at Antioch, and in Syria and Cilicia, greeting.<br />
<span class="w">24</span> Forasmuch as we have heard, that some going out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment:<br />
<span class="w">25</span> It hath seemed good to us, being assembled together, to choose out men, and to send them unto you, with our well beloved Barnabas and Paul:<br />
<span class="w">26</span> Men that have given their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
<span class="w">27</span> We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also will, by word of mouth, tell you the same things.<br />
<span class="w">28</span> For it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay no further burden upon you than these necessary things: <br />
<span class="w">29</span> That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which things keeping yourselves, you shall do well. Fare ye well.<br />
