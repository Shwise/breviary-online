<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">18:14</span>  If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />

<b>Martyrologium </b><em>(anticip.)</em><br />

  <br />
<b>A</b>t Krakow, in Poland, the holy Bishop and martyr Stanislaw, slain by the wicked king Boleslaw II, [in the year 1079.] <br />
<b>A</b>t Tarracina, in Campania, [in the year 99,] the blessed Virgin and martyr Flavia Domitilla. She was sister's daughter to the Consul Flavius Clemens, and had been consecrated with the sacred veil by holy Clement. In the persecution under Domitian she and very many others were banished into the island of Ponza for bearing witness to Christ, and there she endured a long martyrdom. Last of all she was brought to Tarracina, where by her teaching and miracles she turned many to believe in Christ, and then finished the glorious course of her testimony by being burnt in her bed-chamber, wherein she dwelt along with her maidens Euphrosyne and Theodora. Her memory is kept upon the 12th day of May, along with that of the holy martyrs Nereus and Achilles. <br />
<b>[</b>At Benevento,] the holy martyr Juvenal, [Bishop of that see.] <br />
<b>A</b>t Nicomedia, [under the Emperor Diocletian,] the holy brethren Flavius Augustus and Augustine, martyrs. <br />
<b>T</b>here also, in the persecution under the Emperor Decius, the holy martyr Quadratus, who was oftentimes put to the torture, and at last beheaded. <br />
<b>A</b>t Rome, [in the year 686,] the holy Pope and Confessor Benedict. <br />
<b>A</b>t York, in England, [in the year 721,] the holy John [of Beverley,] Bishop [of that see,] famous for his life and miracles, whose feast we keep upon the 25th day of October. <br />
