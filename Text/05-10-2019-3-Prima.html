<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 21(2-12)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">21:2</span>  O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? * Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.<br />
<span class="w">21:3</span>  O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: * and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.<br />
<span class="w">21:4</span>  But thou dwellest in the holy place, * the praise of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">21:5</span>  In thee have our fathers hoped: * they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them.<br />
<span class="w">21:6</span>  They cried to thee, and they were saved: * they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<br />
<span class="w">21:7</span>  But I am a worm, and no man: * the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.<br />
<span class="w">21:8</span>  All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: * they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head.<br />
<span class="w">21:9</span>  He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: * let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him.<br />
<span class="w">21:10</span>  For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: * my hope from the breasts of my mother. I was cast upon thee from the womb.<br />
<span class="w">21:11</span>  From my mother’s womb thou art my God, * depart not from me.<br />
<span class="w">21:12</span>  For tribulation is very near: * for there is none to help me.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 21(13-23)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">21:13</span>  Many calves have surrounded me: * fat bulls have besieged me.<br />
<span class="w">21:14</span>  They have opened their mouths against me, * as a lion ravening and roaring.<br />
<span class="w">21:15</span>  I am poured out like water; * and all my bones are scattered.<br />
<span class="w">21:15</span>  My heart is become like wax melting * in the midst of my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">21:16</span>  My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my jaws: * and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death.<br />
<span class="w">21:17</span>  For many dogs have encompassed me: * the council of the malignant hath besieged me.<br />
<span class="w">21:17</span>  They have dug my hands and feet. * They have numbered all my bones.<br />
<span class="w">21:18</span>  And they have looked and stared upon me. * They parted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.<br />
<span class="w">21:20</span>  But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; * look towards my defence.<br />
<span class="w">21:21</span>  Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: * my only one from the hand of the dog.<br />
<span class="w">21:22</span>  Save me from the lion’s mouth; * and my lowness from the horns of the unicorns.<br />
<span class="w">21:23</span>  I will declare thy name to my brethren: * in the midst of the church will I praise thee.<br />

<span class="w">21:24</span>  Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: * all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him.<br />
<span class="w">21:25</span>  Let all the seed of Israel fear him: * because he hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man.<br />
<span class="w">21:25</span>  Neither hath he turned away his face from me: * and when I cried to him he heard me.<br />
<span class="w">21:26</span>  With thee is my praise in a great church: * I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">21:27</span>  The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: * their hearts shall live for ever and ever.<br />
<span class="w">21:28</span>  All the ends of the earth * shall remember, and shall be converted to the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">21:28</span>  And all the kindreds of the Gentiles * shall adore in his sight.<br />
<span class="w">21:29</span>  For the kingdom is the Lord’s; * and he shall have dominion over the nations.<br />
<span class="w">21:30</span>  All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: * all they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.<br />
<span class="w">21:31</span>  And to him my soul shall live: * and my seed shall serve him.<br />
<span class="w">21:32</span>  There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: * and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made.<br />

<b>Martyrologium </b><em>(anticip.)</em><br />
 <br />
<i class="a">O</i>n the morrow we keep the feast of the holy Pope of Rome, Pius, fifth of that name, a Friar Preacher, of whom mention is made upon the 5th day of this present month. He toiled manfully and hopefully for the restoration of the discipline of the Church, for the extirpation of heresies, and for the defeat of the enemies of the Christian name, and ruled the Catholic Church in holiness of life and government. <br />
<b>M</b>ay 11th 2019, the 7th day of the Moon, were born into the better life: <br />
  <br />
<b>A</b>t Rome, upon the Salarian Way, the blessed Priest Anthimus. After he had done excellently well in power and preaching, he was thrown into the Tiber during the persecution under Diocletian, and thence delivered by an angel, who brought him back to his own oratory but he was lastly beheaded, and so passed into heaven as a conqueror. <br />
<b>U</b>pon the same day, the holy martyr Evellius. He was one of Nero's household, who believed on Christ on seeing the passion of the holy martyr Torpes, and was therefore beheaded. <br />
<b>A</b>lso at Rome, the holy martyrs Maximus, Bassus, and Fabius, who were killed upon the Salarian Way, in the persecution under Diocletian. <br />
<b>A</b>t Camarino, the holy martyrs Anastasius and his Companions, who were put to death under Antiochus the President, in the persecution under Decius. <br />
<b>A</b>t Osimo, in Picenum, the holy martyrs Sisinnius the Deacon, Diocletius, and Florence, disciples of the holy Priest Anthimus, who finished their testimony by being stoned to death, in the persecution under Diocletian. <br />
<b>A</b>t Varennes, [in the eighth century,] the holy martyr Gangulph. <br />
<b>A</b>t Vienne, [toward the end of the fifth century,] the holy Mamertus, Bishop [of that see,] who, on account of a threatening volcanic eruption, instituted in that city the solemn Rogation processions upon the three days before the Ascension of the Lord, the which custom the Universal Church hath since approved by adopting it. <br />
<b>A</b>t Sauvigny, [in the year 994,] deceased holy Majolus, Abbot of Cluny, whose life was illustrious for holy and worthy deeds. <br />
<b>A</b>t the town now called San Severino, in Picenum, the holy Confessor Illuminatus. <br />
<b>I</b>n the town of Grotaglia, in the Diocese of Taranto, [in the year 1716,] the holy Confessor Francis di Girolamo, of the Society of Jesus, an example of singular love and patience in seeking the salvation of souls. Pope Gregory XVI enrolled his name with those of the Saints. His burial is commemorated with great solemnity in the church of the Professed House of his Order at Naples, where his body lieth. <br />
