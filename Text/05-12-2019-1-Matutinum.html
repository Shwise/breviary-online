<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> thou, the heavens' eternal King,<br />
Creator, unto thee we sing,<br />
With God the Father ever One,<br />
Co-equal, co-eternal Son.<br />
 <br />
Thy hand, when first the world began,<br />
Made in thine own pure image man,<br />
And linked to Adam, sprung from earth,<br />
A living soul of heavenly birth.<br />
 <br />
And when by craft the envious foe<br />
Had marred thy noblest work below,<br />
Clothed in our flesh, thou didst restore<br />
The image thou hadst made before.<br />
 <br />
Once wast thou born of Mary's womb;<br />
And now, new-born from out the tomb,<br />
O Christ, thou bidd'st us rise with thee<br />
From death to immortality.<br />
 <br />
Eternal Shepherd, thou dost lave<br />
Thy flock in pure baptismal wave,<br />
That mystic bath, that grave of sin,<br />
Where ransomed souls new life begin.<br />
 <br />
Redeemer, thou for us didst deign<br />
To hang upon the Cross of pain,<br />
And give for us the lavish price<br />
Of thine own blood in sacrifice.<br />
 <br />
Grant, Lord, in thee each faithful mind<br />
Unceasing paschal joy may find;<br />
And from the death of sin set free<br />
Souls newly born to life by thee.<br />
 <br />
To thee, once dead, who now dost live,<br />
All glory, Lord, thy people give,<br />
Whom, with the Father, we adore,<br />
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 16:16-22</span><br />
At that time, Jesus said to his disciples: A little while, and now you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Tract 101 of John</span><br />
This little while is the whole duration of this present world. In the same sense this same Evangelist saith in his Epistle <span class="w">ii. 18</span>: It is the last time. The words, because I go to the Father, refer to the first clause of the text, namely, A little while and ye shall not see Me, and not to the latter clause, that is, and again a little while, and ye shall see Me. By His going to the Father He was about to bring it to pass that they should see Him no more. And thus it was that He said, not that He was about to die, and that after His death they should not see Him until He rose again, but that He was going to the Father, which He did when, after that He was risen again and had manifested Himself to them for forty days, He ascended up into heaven.<br />
