<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> thou, the heavens' eternal King,<br />
Creator, unto thee we sing,<br />
With God the Father ever One,<br />
Co-equal, co-eternal Son.<br />
 <br />
Thy hand, when first the world began,<br />
Made in thine own pure image man,<br />
And linked to Adam, sprung from earth,<br />
A living soul of heavenly birth.<br />
 <br />
And when by craft the envious foe<br />
Had marred thy noblest work below,<br />
Clothed in our flesh, thou didst restore<br />
The image thou hadst made before.<br />
 <br />
Once wast thou born of Mary's womb;<br />
And now, new-born from out the tomb,<br />
O Christ, thou bidd'st us rise with thee<br />
From death to immortality.<br />
 <br />
Eternal Shepherd, thou dost lave<br />
Thy flock in pure baptismal wave,<br />
That mystic bath, that grave of sin,<br />
Where ransomed souls new life begin.<br />
 <br />
Redeemer, thou for us didst deign<br />
To hang upon the Cross of pain,<br />
And give for us the lavish price<br />
Of thine own blood in sacrifice.<br />
 <br />
Grant, Lord, in thee each faithful mind<br />
Unceasing paschal joy may find;<br />
And from the death of sin set free<br />
Souls newly born to life by thee.<br />
 <br />
To thee, once dead, who now dost live,<br />
All glory, Lord, thy people give,<br />
Whom, with the Father, we adore,<br />
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">34:2</span>  Take hold of arms and shield: * and rise up to help me.<br />
<span class="w">34:3</span>  Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: * say to my soul: I am thy salvation.<br />
<span class="w">34:4</span>  Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek after my soul.<br />

<span class="w">34:6</span>  Let their way become dark and slippery; * and let the Angel of the Lord pursue them.<br />
<span class="w">34:7</span>  For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: * without cause they have upbraided my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:8</span>  Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: * and into that very snare let them fall.<br />
<span class="w">34:9</span>  But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; * and shall be delighted in his salvation.<br />
<span class="w">34:10</span>  All my bones shall say: * Lord, who is like to thee?<br />

<span class="w">34:12</span>  They repaid me evil for good: * to the depriving me of my soul.<br />

<span class="w">34:13</span>  I humbled my soul with fasting; * and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom.<br />
<span class="w">34:14</span>  As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: * as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.<br />

<span class="w">34:18</span>  I will give thanks to thee in a great church; * I will praise thee in a strong people.<br />
<span class="w">34:19</span>  Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: * who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">34:20</span>  For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; * and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.<br />
<span class="w">34:21</span>  And they opened their mouth wide against me; * they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.<br />
<span class="w">34:22</span>  Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: * O Lord, depart not from me.<br />
<span class="w">34:23</span>  Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: * to my cause, my God, and my Lord.<br />
<span class="w">34:24</span>  Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, * and let them not rejoice over me.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 36(1-15)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:1</span>  Be not emulous of evildoers; * nor envy them that work iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">36:2</span>  For they shall shortly wither away as grass, * and as the green herbs shall quickly fall.<br />
<span class="w">36:3</span>  Trust in the Lord, and do good, * and dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with its riches.<br />
<span class="w">36:4</span>  Delight in the Lord, * and he will give thee the requests of thy heart.<br />
<span class="w">36:5</span>  Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, * and he will do it.<br />

<span class="w">36:12</span>  The sinner shall watch the just man: * and shall gnash upon him with his teeth.<br />
<span class="w">36:13</span>  But the Lord shall laugh at him: * for he foreseeth that his day shall come.<br />
<span class="w">36:14</span>  The wicked have drawn out the sword: * they have bent their bow.<br />

<span class="w">2</span> And immediately I was in the spirit: and behold there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And he that sat, was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine stone; and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats, four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments, and on their heads were crowns of gold.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.<br />

<span class="w">8</span> And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; and round about and within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.<br />
