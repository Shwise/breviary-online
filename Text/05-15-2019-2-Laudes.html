<i class="a">B</i>lessed is the rich man that is found without blemish: and that hath not gone after gold, nor put his trust in money nor in treasures. Who is he, and we will praise him? for he hath done wonderful things in his life.<br />

<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esu, eternal truth sublime,<br />
Through endless years the same!<br />
Thou crown of those who through all time<br />
Confess thy holy name:<br />
 <br />
Thy suppliant people, through the prayer<br />
Of thy blest saint, forgive;<br />
For his dear sake, thy wrath forbear,<br />
And bid our spirits live.<br />
 <br />
Again returns the sacred day,<br />
With heavenly glory bright,<br />
Which saw him go upon his way<br />
Into the realms of light.<br />
 <br />
All objects of our vain desire,<br />
All earthly joys and gains,<br />
To him were but as filthy mire;<br />
And now with thee he reigns.<br />
 <br />
Thee, Jesu, his all-gracious Lord,<br />
Confessing to the last,<br />
He trod beneath him Satan's fraud,<br />
And stood forever fast.<br />
 <br />
In holy deeds of faith and love,<br />
In fastings and in prayers,<br />
His days were spent; and now above<br />
Thy heavenly feast he shares.<br />
 <br />
Then, for his sake thy wrath lay by,<br />
And hear us while we pray;<br />
And pardon us, O thou most high,<br />
On this his festal day.<br />
 <br />
* All glory to the Father be;<br />
And sole Incarnate Son;<br />
Praise, holy Paraclete, to thee;<br />
While endless ages run.<br />
Amen.<br />
