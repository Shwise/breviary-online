<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> thou, the heavens' eternal King,<br />
Creator, unto thee we sing,<br />
With God the Father ever One,<br />
Co-equal, co-eternal Son.<br />
 <br />
Thy hand, when first the world began,<br />
Made in thine own pure image man,<br />
And linked to Adam, sprung from earth,<br />
A living soul of heavenly birth.<br />
 <br />
And when by craft the envious foe<br />
Had marred thy noblest work below,<br />
Clothed in our flesh, thou didst restore<br />
The image thou hadst made before.<br />
 <br />
Once wast thou born of Mary's womb;<br />
And now, new-born from out the tomb,<br />
O Christ, thou bidd'st us rise with thee<br />
From death to immortality.<br />
 <br />
Eternal Shepherd, thou dost lave<br />
Thy flock in pure baptismal wave,<br />
That mystic bath, that grave of sin,<br />
Where ransomed souls new life begin.<br />
 <br />
Redeemer, thou for us didst deign<br />
To hang upon the Cross of pain,<br />
And give for us the lavish price<br />
Of thine own blood in sacrifice.<br />
 <br />
Grant, Lord, in thee each faithful mind<br />
Unceasing paschal joy may find;<br />
And from the death of sin set free<br />
Souls newly born to life by thee.<br />
 <br />
To thee, once dead, who now dost live,<br />
All glory, Lord, thy people give,<br />
Whom, with the Father, we adore,<br />
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
From the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 16:5-14</span><br />
At that time, Jesus said unto His disciples: I go My way to Him That sent Me, and none of you asketh Me: Whither goest Thou? And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo.<br />
<span class="ri">94th Tract on John.</span><br />
The Lord Jesus told His disciples what things they should suffer after that He was gone away from them, and then He said: "These things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you; but now I go My way to Him That sent Me." Let us first see whether it had been that He had not told them before this what they were to suffer in time coming. That He had done so amply before the night of the last Supper, is testified by the three first Evangelists, but it was when that Supper was ended that, according to John, He said: "These things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you."<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
