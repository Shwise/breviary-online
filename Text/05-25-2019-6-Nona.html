<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> strength and stay upholding all creation,<br />
Who ever dost thyself unmoved abide,<br />
Yet day by day the light in due gradation<br />
From hour to hour through all its changes guide:<br />
 <br />
Grant to life’s day a calm unclouded ending,<br />
An eve untouched by shadows of decay,<br />
The brightness of a holy death-bed blending<br />
With dawning glories of th’ eternal day.<br />
 <br />
* Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,<br />
And thou, O Christ, the co-eternal Word,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living<br />
Now and to endless ages art adored.<br />
Amen.<br />
<b>Psalms</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Alleluia, * alleluia, alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 108(2-13)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">108:2</span>  God, be not thou silent in my praise: * for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me.<br />
<span class="w">108:3</span>  They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred; * and have fought against me without cause.<br />
<span class="w">108:4</span>  Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: * but I gave myself to prayer.<br />
<span class="w">108:5</span>  And they repaid me evil for good: * and hatred for my love.<br />
<span class="w">108:6</span>  Set thou the sinner over him: * and may the devil stand at his right hand.<br />
<span class="w">108:7</span>  When he is judged, may he go out condemned; * and may his prayer be turned to sin.<br />
<span class="w">108:8</span>  May his days be few: * and his bishopric let another take.<br />
<span class="w">108:9</span>  May his children be fatherless, * and his wife a widow.<br />
<span class="w">108:10</span>  Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; * and let them be cast out of their dwellings.<br />
<span class="w">108:11</span>  May the usurer search all his substance: * and let strangers plunder his labours.<br />
<span class="w">108:12</span>  May there be none to help him: * nor none to pity his fatherless offspring.<br />
<span class="w">108:13</span>  May his posterity be cut off; * in one generation may his name be blotted out.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 108(14-21)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">108:14</span>  May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of the Lord: * and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.<br />
<span class="w">108:15</span>  May they be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth: * because he remembered not to shew mercy,<br />
<span class="w">108:17</span>  But persecuted the poor man and the beggar; * and the broken in heart, to put him to death.<br />
<span class="w">108:18</span>  And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: * and he would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him.<br />
<span class="w">108:18</span>  And he put on cursing, like a garment: * and it went in like water into his entrails, and like oil in his bones.<br />
<span class="w">108:19</span>  May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; * and like a girdle with which he is girded continually.<br />
<span class="w">108:20</span>  This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; * and who speak evils against my soul.<br />
<span class="w">108:21</span>  But thou, O Lord, do with me for thy name’s sake: * because thy mercy is sweet.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 108(22-31)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">108:22</span>  Do thou deliver me, for I am poor and needy, * and my heart is troubled within me.<br />
<span class="w">108:23</span>  I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: * and I am shaken off as locusts.<br />
<span class="w">108:24</span>  My knees are weakened through fasting: * and my flesh is changed for oil.<br />
<span class="w">108:25</span>  And I am become a reproach to them: * they saw me and they shaked their heads.<br />
<span class="w">108:26</span>  Help me, O Lord my God; * save me according to thy mercy.<br />
<span class="w">108:27</span>  And let them know that this is thy hand: * and that thou, O Lord, hast done it.<br />
<span class="w">108:28</span>  They will curse and thou wilt bless: * let them that rise up against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">108:29</span>  Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: * and let them be covered with their confusion as with a double cloak.<br />
<span class="w">108:30</span>  I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: * and in the midst of many I will praise him.<br />
<span class="w">108:31</span>  Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, * to save my soul from persecutors.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
