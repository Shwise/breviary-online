<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of the season}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">E</i>ternal Monarch, King most high,<br />
Whose blood hath brought redemption nigh,<br />
By whom the death of death was wrought,<br />
And conquering grace's battle fought:<br />
 <br />
Ascending by the starry road,<br />
This day thou wentest home to God,<br />
By heaven to power unending called,<br />
And by no human hand installed.<br />
 <br />
That so, in nature's triple frame,<br />
Each heavenly and each earthly name,<br />
And things in hell's abyss abhorred,<br />
May bend the knee and own him Lord.<br />
 <br />
Yea, angels tremble when they see<br />
How changed is our humanity;<br />
That flesh hath purged what flesh had stained,<br />
And God, the flesh of God, hath reigned.<br />
 <br />
Be thou our joy, O mighty Lord,<br />
As thou wilt be our great reward;<br />
Earth's joys to thee are nothing worth,<br />
Thou joy and crown of heaven and earth.<br />
 <br />
To thee we therefore humbly pray<br />
That thou wouldst purge our sins away,<br />
And draw our hearts by cords of grace<br />
To thy celestial dwelling-place.<br />
 <br />
So when the judgement day shall come,<br />
And all must rise to meet their doom,<br />
Thou wilt remit the debts we owe,<br />
And our lost crowns again bestow.<br />
 <br />
All glory, Lord, to thee we pay,<br />
Ascending o'er the stars today;<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To Father and to Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">4</span> And eating together with them, he commanded them, that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but should wait for the promise of the Father, which you have heard (saith he) by my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> For John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.<br />

From the Sermons of Pope St. Leo the Great.<br />
<span class="ri">1st on the Lords Ascension.</span><br />
After the blessed and glorious Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, wherein the Divine Power raised up in three days the true Temple of God Which the iniquity of the Jews had destroyed <span class="w">John ii. 19,</span> God was pleased to ordain, by His Most Sacred Will, and in His Providence for our instruction and the profit of our souls, a season of forty days which season, dearly beloved brethren, doth end on this day. During that season the bodily Presence of the Lord still lingered on earth, that the reality of the fact of His having risen again from the dead might be armed with all needful proofs. The death of Christ had troubled the hearts of many of His disciples their thoughts were sad when they remembered His agony upon the Cross, His giving up of the Ghost, and the laying in the grave of His lifeless Body, and a sort of hesitation had begun to weigh on them.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> My time is come that I should return unto Him That sent Me, saith the Lord. Be not sorrowful, neither let your heart be troubled.<br />
* I pray the Father for you, that He may keep you. Alleluia, Alleluia.<br />

Hence the most blessed Apostles and all the disciples, who had been fearful at the finishing on the Cross, and doubtful of the trustworthiness of the rising again, were so strengthened by the clear demonstration of the fact, that, when they saw the Lord going up into the height of heaven, they sorrowed not, nay they were even filled with great joy And, in all verity, it was a great an unspeakable cause for joy to see the Manhood, in the presence of that the multitude of believers, exalted above all creatures even heavenly, rising above the ranks of the angelic armies and speeding Its glorious way where the most noble of the Archangels lie far behind, to rest no lower than that place where high above all principality and power, It taketh Its seat at the right hand of the Eternal Father, Sharer of His throne, and Partaker of His glory, and still of the very man's nature which the Son hath taken upon Him.<br />

Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us also rejoice with worthy joy, for the Ascension of Christ is exaltation for us, and whither the glory of the Head of the Church is passed in, thither is the hope of the body of the Church called on to follow. Let us rejoice with exceeding great joy, and give God glad thanks. This day is not only the possession of Paradise made sure unto us, but in the Person of our Head we are actually begun to enter into the heavenly mansions above. Through the unspeakable goodness of Christ we have gained more than ever we lost by the envy of the devil. We, whom our<br />
venomous enemy thrust from our first happy home, we, being made of one body with the Son of God, have by Him been given a place at the right hand of the Father with Whom He liveth and reigneth, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. Amen.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Mark<br />
<span class="ri">Mark 16:14-20</span><br />
At that time, Jesus appeared unto the eleven disciples as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by Pope St. Gregory the Great<br />
<span class="ri">29th on the Gospels</span><br />
I may be allowed to say that the disciples' slowness to believe that the Lord had indeed risen from the dead, was not so much their weakness as our strength. In consequence of their doubts, the fact of the Resurrection was demonstrated by many infallible proofs. These proofs we read and acknowledge. What then assureth our faith, if not their doubt? For my part, I put my trust in Thomas, who doubted long, much more than in Mary Magdalene, who believed at once. Through his doubting, he came actually to handle the holes of the Wounds, and thereby closed up any wound of doubt in our hearts.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter,<br />
* That He may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth. Alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> That He may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth. Alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />
 <br />
<b>Reading 8</b><br />
Now confirm to our minds the trustworthiness of the fact that our Lord did indeed rise again from the dead, it is well for us to remark one of the statements of Luke <span class="w">Acts i. 4.</span> "Eating together with them, He commanded them that they should not <span class="w">1 John xiv. 16, 17 xvi. 7.</span> depart from Jerusalem and a little afterward: "While they beheld, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight." Consider these words, note well these mysteries. After "eating together with them He was taken up." He ate and ascended: that the fact of His eating might show the reality of the Body in Which He went up. But Mark telleth us that before the Lord ascended into heaven, He upbraided His disciples; with their unbelief and hardness of heart. From this I know not why we should gather, but that the Lord then upbraided His disciples, for whom He was about to be parted in the body, to the end that the words which He spoke unto them as He left them might be the deeper imprinted on their hearts.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thou makest the clouds the chariot, O Lord,<br />

<b>Reading 9</b><br />
When then, He had rebuked the hardness of their heart, what command did He give them? Let us hear. "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature." Was the Holy Gospel, then my brethren, to be preached to thing insensate, or to brute beasts, that the Lord said to His disciples: "Preach the Gospel to every creature"? Nay, but by the words "every creature" we must understand man, in whom are combined qualities of all creatures. Being he hath in common with stones, life in common with trees, feeling in common with beasts, understanding in common with angels. If, then, man hath something in common with every creature, man is to a certain extent every creature. The Gospel, then, if it be preached to man only, is preached to every creature.<br />
