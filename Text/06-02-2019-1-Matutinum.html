<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">E</i>ternal Monarch, King most high,<br />
Whose blood hath brought redemption nigh,<br />
By whom the death of death was wrought,<br />
And conquering grace's battle fought:<br />
 <br />
Ascending by the starry road,<br />
This day thou wentest home to God,<br />
By heaven to power unending called,<br />
And by no human hand installed.<br />
 <br />
That so, in nature's triple frame,<br />
Each heavenly and each earthly name,<br />
And things in hell's abyss abhorred,<br />
May bend the knee and own him Lord.<br />
 <br />
Yea, angels tremble when they see<br />
How changed is our humanity;<br />
That flesh hath purged what flesh had stained,<br />
And God, the flesh of God, hath reigned.<br />
 <br />
Be thou our joy, O mighty Lord,<br />
As thou wilt be our great reward;<br />
Earth's joys to thee are nothing worth,<br />
Thou joy and crown of heaven and earth.<br />
 <br />
To thee we therefore humbly pray<br />
That thou wouldst purge our sins away,<br />
And draw our hearts by cords of grace<br />
To thy celestial dwelling-place.<br />
 <br />
So when the judgement day shall come,<br />
And all must rise to meet their doom,<br />
Thou wilt remit the debts we owe,<br />
And our lost crowns again bestow.<br />
 <br />
All glory, Lord, to thee we pay,<br />
Ascending o'er the stars today;<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To Father and to Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo.<br />
<span class="ri">Tract 92 John.</span><br />
The Lord Jesus, in that discourse which He addressed to His disciples after the Last Supper, when He was on the very eve of the Passion, when He was, as it were, about to go away and leave them as touching His bodily Presence, albeit as touching His spiritual Presence, He is with us alway even unto the end of the world, <span class="w">Matth. xxviii. 20,</span> in that discourse He exhorted them to bear patiently the persecution of wicked men, of whom He speaketh as "the world", out of which world, nevertheless, He saith that He hath chosen even His disciples themselves, <span class="w">xv. 19,</span> that they might know that it was by the grace of God that they were what they were, <span class="w">1 Cor. xv. 10,</span> whereas it was by their own sins that they had been what they had been.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man, * thou didst not abhor the Virgin's womb.<br />
 <br />
When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, * thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.<br />
Thou sittest at the right hand of God, * in the glory of the Father.<br />
We believe that thou shalt come * to be our Judge.<br />

Govern them, * and lift them up for ever.<br />
Day by day * we magnify thee;<br />

O Lord, in thee have I trusted, * let me never be confounded.<br />
