<span class="w">95:3</span>  Declare his glory among the Gentiles: * his wonders among all people.<br />
<span class="w">95:4</span>  For the Lord is great, and exceedingly to be praised: * he is to be feared above all gods.<br />
<span class="w">95:5</span>  For all the gods of the Gentiles are devils: * but the Lord made the heavens.<br />
<span class="w">95:6</span>  Praise and beauty are before him: * holiness and majesty in his sanctuary.<br />

<span class="w">13:1</span>  Thou art great, O Lord, for ever, * and thy kingdom is unto all ages:<br />
<span class="w">13:2</span>  For thou scourgest, and thou savest: thou leadest down to hell, and bringest up again: * and there is none that can escape thy hand.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Give glory to the Lord, ye children of Israel, * and praise him in the sight of the Gentiles:<br />

<span class="w">134:3</span>  Praise ye the Lord, for the Lord is good: * sing ye to his name, for it is sweet.<br />
<span class="w">134:4</span>  For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: * Israel for his own possession.<br />

<span class="w">134:9</span>  He sent forth signs and wonders in the midst of thee, O Egypt: * upon Pharao, and upon all his servants.<br />
<span class="w">134:10</span>  He smote many nations, * and slew mighty kings:<br />
<span class="w">134:11</span>  Sehon king of the Amorrhites, and Og king of Basan, * and all the kingdoms of Chanaan.<br />
<span class="w">134:12</span>  And gave their land for an inheritance, * for an inheritance to his people Israel.<br />
<span class="w">134:13</span>  Thy name, O Lord, is for ever: * thy memorial, O Lord, unto all generations.<br />

<span class="ri">Sir 31:8-9</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>lessed is the rich man that is found without blemish: and that hath not gone after gold, nor put his trust in money nor in treasures. Who is he, and we will praise him? for he hath done wonderful things in his life.<br />

<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esu, eternal truth sublime,<br />
Through endless years the same!<br />
Thou crown of those who through all time<br />
Confess thy holy name:<br />
 <br />
Thy suppliant people, through the prayer<br />
Of thy blest saint, forgive;<br />
For his dear sake, thy wrath forbear,<br />
And bid our spirits live.<br />
 <br />
Again returns the sacred day,<br />
With heavenly glory bright,<br />
Which saw him go upon his way<br />
Into the realms of light.<br />
 <br />
All objects of our vain desire,<br />
All earthly joys and gains,<br />
To him were but as filthy mire;<br />
And now with thee he reigns.<br />
 <br />
Thee, Jesu, his all-gracious Lord,<br />
Confessing to the last,<br />
He trod beneath him Satan's fraud,<br />
And stood forever fast.<br />
 <br />
In holy deeds of faith and love,<br />
In fastings and in prayers,<br />
His days were spent; and now above<br />
Thy heavenly feast he shares.<br />
 <br />
Then, for his sake thy wrath lay by,<br />
And hear us while we pray;<br />
And pardon us, O thou most high,<br />
On this his festal day.<br />
 <br />
* All glory to the Father be;<br />
And sole Incarnate Son;<br />
Praise, holy Paraclete, to thee;<br />
While endless ages run.<br />
Amen.<br />
