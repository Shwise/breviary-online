<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow Christ, ascending whence he came,<br />
Had mounted o'er the starry frame,<br />
The Holy Ghost on man below,<br />
The Father's promise, to bestow.<br />
 <br />
The solemn time was drawing nigh,<br />
Replete with heav'nly mystery,<br />
On seven days' sevenfold circles borne,<br />
That first and blessèd Whitsun-morn.<br />
 <br />
When the third hour shone all around,<br />
There came a rushing mighty sound,<br />
And told the Apostles, while in prayer,<br />
That, as was promised, God was there.<br />
 <br />
Forth from the Father's light it came,<br />
That beautiful and kindly flame:<br />
To fill with fervour of his word<br />
The spirits faithful to their Lord.<br />
 <br />
With joy the Apostles' breasts are fired,<br />
By God the Holy Ghost inspired:<br />
And straight, in divers kinds of speech,<br />
The wondrous works of God they preach.<br />
 <br />
To men of every race they speak,<br />
Alike barbarian, Roman, Greek:<br />
From the same lips, with awe and fear,<br />
All men their native accents hear.<br />
 <br />
But Juda's sons, e'en faithless yet,<br />
With mad infuriate rage beset,<br />
To mock Christ's followers combine,<br />
As drunken all with new-made wine.<br />
 <br />
When lo! with signs and mighty deeds,<br />
Stands Peter in the midst, and pleads;<br />
Confounding their malignant lie<br />
By Joel's ancient prophecy.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father let us sing,<br />
To God the Son, our risen King,<br />
And equally let us adore<br />
The Spirit, God forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">47:3</span>  With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded, * on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.<br />
<span class="w">47:4</span>  In her houses shall God be known, * when he shall protect her.<br />
<span class="w">47:5</span>  For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves: * they gathered together.<br />
<span class="w">47:6</span>  So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were moved: * trembling took hold of them.<br />
<span class="w">47:7</span>  There were pains as of a woman in labour; * with a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis.<br />
<span class="w">47:9</span>  As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: * God hath founded it for ever.<br />

<span class="w">67:4</span>  And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: * and be delighted with gladness.<br />
<span class="w">67:5</span> Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name, * make a way for him who ascendeth upon the west: <span class="w">(bow head)</span> The Lord is his name.<br />
<span class="w">67:5</span>  Rejoice ye before him: * but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence, who is the father of orphans, and the judge of widows.<br />
<span class="w">67:6</span>  God in his holy place: * God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house:<br />
<span class="w">67:7</span>  Who bringeth out them that were bound in strength; * in like manner them that provoke, that dwell in sepulchres.<br />
<span class="w">67:8</span>  O God, when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people, * when thou didst pass through the desert:<br />
<span class="w">67:9</span>  The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the presence of the God of Sinai, * at the presence of the God of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">67:10</span>  Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain, * O God: and it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect.<br />
<span class="w">67:11</span>  In it shall thy animals dwell; * in thy sweetness, O God, thou hast provided for the poor.<br />
<span class="w">67:12</span>  The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings, * with great power.<br />
<span class="w">67:13</span>  The king of powers is of the beloved, * of the beloved; and the beauty of the house shall divide spoils.<br />
<span class="w">67:14</span>  If you sleep among the midst of lots, you shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, * and the hinder parts of her back with the paleness of gold.<br />
<span class="w">67:15</span>  When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, * they shall be whited with snow in Selmon.<br />
<span class="w">67:16</span>  The mountain of God is a fat mountain, a curdled mountain, a fat mountain; * Why suspect, ye curdled mountains?<br />
<span class="w">67:17</span>  A mountain in which God is well pleased to dwell: * for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end.<br />
<span class="w">67:18</span>  The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands; thousands of them that rejoice: * the Lord is among them in Sinai, in the holy place.<br />
<span class="w">67:19</span>  Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; * thou hast received gifts in men.<br />
<span class="w">67:19</span>  Yea for those also that do not believe, * the dwelling of the Lord God.<br />
<span class="w">67:20</span>  Blessed be the Lord day by day: * the God of our salvation will make our journey prosperous to us.<br />
<span class="w">67:21</span>  Our God is the God of salvation: * and of the Lord, of the Lord are the issues from death.<br />
<span class="w">67:22</span>  But God shall break the heads of his enemies: * the hairy crown of them that walk on in their sins.<br />
<span class="w">67:23</span>  The Lord said: I will turn them from Basan, * I will turn them into the depth of the sea:<br />
<span class="w">67:24</span>  That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies; * the tongue of thy dogs be red with the same.<br />

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 3:16-21</span><br />
At that time, Jesus said unto Nicodemus: God so loved the world that He gave His Only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo<br />
<span class="ri">12th Tract on John</span><br />
The Physician cometh that, as often as in him lieth, he may heal the sick man. He is his own destroyer who will not keep the commandments of the Physician. Into the world came the Saviour. Why is He called the Saviour of the world, but because He came "into the world not to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved"? If thou willest not be saved through Him, thou wilt be condemned of thyself. And why say I that thou wilt be condemned? Because it is written: "He that believeth in Him is not condemned." What then canst thou hope that He will say of "him that believeth not," but that He will be condemned And indeed He doth say farther: "He that believeth not is condemned already." He is condemned already, though the condemnation be not yet openly pronounced.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Henceforth I call you not servants, but I have called you My friends, because ye have known all things, whatsoever I have done among you. Alleluia.<br />
* Receive ye the Holy Ghost, Who is your Comforter within you; the Same is He Whom the Father will send unto you. Alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Ye are My friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Receive ye the Holy Ghost Who is your Comforter within you; the Same is He Whom the Father will send unto you. Alleluia.<br />

He is condemned already, for "the Lord knoweth them that are His." He knoweth them for whom is laid up the crown, and likewise them that are reserved unto the fire. His eye seeth in the field of the world the distinction of the wheat and of the straw, of the good corn and of the tares. "He that believeth not is condemned already." And why? "Because he hath not believed in the Name of the Only-begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil." "Because their deeds were evil”, but, my brethren, is there one man of whom God findeth that his works are good? No, not one. God findeth all works to be (in themselves) bad. How then do we hear that some there be who do truth, and come to the light? For these words come anon: "But he that doeth truth, cometh to the light."<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
But the Lord saith [of such as these, who are condemned already, because they believe not in Him]: "They loved darkness rather than light." And here He maketh the great point [of difference between such, and them that do the truth.] There are many who have loved their sins there are many who have confessed their sins and he that confessed and denounceth his sin, is working already with God. God denounceth thy sins, and if thou denounce them likewise, then dost thou join thyself with God in His act. The man and the sinner are two different things. God made the man, and the man made the sinner. Put away thy work, and God will save His. Thou art behoven to hate in thyself thine own work, and to love God's work. When thine own works begin to displease thee, then is it that thou beginnest to do well, because thou denouncest thine own evil works. The first thing to do, if thou wouldest do good works, is to acknowledge thine evil ones.<br />
