<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<span class="ri">The first verse of the following hymn is said genuflecting.</span><br />
<i class="a">C</i>reator Spirit, all Divine,<br />
Come, visit every soul of Thine,<br />
And fill with Thy celestial flame<br />
The hearts which Thou Thyself didst frame.<br />
 <br />
O gift of God, Thine is the sweet<br />
Consoling name of Paraclete<br />
And spring of life and fire and love<br />
And unction flowing from above.<br />
 <br />
The mystic sevenfold gifts are Thine,<br />
Finger of God's right hand divine;<br />
The Father's promise sent to teach<br />
The tongue a rich and heavenly speech.<br />
 <br />
Kindle with fire brought from above<br />
Each sense, and fill our hearts with love;<br />
And grant our flesh, so weak and frail,<br />
The strength of Thine which cannot fail.<br />
 <br />
Drive far away our deadly foe,<br />
And grant us Thy true peace to know;<br />
So we, led by Thy guidance still,<br />
May safely pass through every ill.<br />
 <br />
To us, through Thee, the grace be shown<br />
To know the Father and the Son;<br />
And Spirit of Them both, may we<br />
Forever rest our faith in Thee.<br />
 <br />
To Sire and Son be praises meet,<br />
And to the Holy Paraclete;<br />
And may Christ send us from above<br />
That Holy Spirit's gift of love.<br />
Amen<br />

<span class="w">118:55</span>  In the night I have remembered thy name, O Lord: * and have kept thy law.<br />
<span class="w">118:56</span>  This happened to me: * because I sought after thy justifications.<br />
