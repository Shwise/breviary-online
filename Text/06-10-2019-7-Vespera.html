<i class="a">C</i>reator-Spirit, all-divine,<br />
Come, visit every soul of thine,<br />
And fill with thy celestial flame<br />
The hearts which thou thyself didst frame.<br />
 <br />
O gift of God, thine is the sweet<br />
Consoling name of Paraclete<br />
And spring of life and fire and love<br />
And unction flowing from above.<br />
 <br />
The mystic sevenfold gifts are thine,<br />
Finger of God's right hand divine;<br />
The Father's promise sent to teach<br />
The tongue a rich and heavenly speech.<br />
 <br />
Kindle with fire brought from above<br />
Each sense, and fill our hearts with love;<br />
And grant our flesh, so weak and frail,<br />
The strength of thine which cannot fail.<br />
 <br />
Drive far away our deadly foe,<br />
And grant us thy true peace to know;<br />
So we, led by thy guidance still,<br />
May safely pass through every ill.<br />
 <br />
To us, through thee, the grace be shown<br />
To know the Father and the Son;<br />
And Spirit of them both, may we<br />
Forever rest our faith in thee.<br />
 <br />
To Sire and Son be praises meet,<br />
And to the Holy Paraclete;<br />
And may Christ send us from above<br />
