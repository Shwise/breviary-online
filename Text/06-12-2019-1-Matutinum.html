<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow Christ, ascending whence he came,<br />
Had mounted o'er the starry frame,<br />
The Holy Ghost on man below,<br />
The Father's promise, to bestow.<br />
 <br />
The solemn time was drawing nigh,<br />
Replete with heav'nly mystery,<br />
On seven days' sevenfold circles borne,<br />
That first and blessèd Whitsun-morn.<br />
 <br />
When the third hour shone all around,<br />
There came a rushing mighty sound,<br />
And told the Apostles, while in prayer,<br />
That, as was promised, God was there.<br />
 <br />
Forth from the Father's light it came,<br />
That beautiful and kindly flame:<br />
To fill with fervour of his word<br />
The spirits faithful to their Lord.<br />
 <br />
With joy the Apostles' breasts are fired,<br />
By God the Holy Ghost inspired:<br />
And straight, in divers kinds of speech,<br />
The wondrous works of God they preach.<br />
 <br />
To men of every race they speak,<br />
Alike barbarian, Roman, Greek:<br />
From the same lips, with awe and fear,<br />
All men their native accents hear.<br />
 <br />
But Juda's sons, e'en faithless yet,<br />
With mad infuriate rage beset,<br />
To mock Christ's followers combine,<br />
As drunken all with new-made wine.<br />
 <br />
When lo! with signs and mighty deeds,<br />
Stands Peter in the midst, and pleads;<br />
Confounding their malignant lie<br />
By Joel's ancient prophecy.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father let us sing,<br />
To God the Son, our risen King,<br />
And equally let us adore<br />
The Spirit, God forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Suddenly there came a sound from heaven * as of a rushing mighty wind, alleluia, alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 47</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">47:2</span>  Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised * in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.<br />
<span class="w">47:3</span>  With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded, * on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.<br />
<span class="w">47:4</span>  In her houses shall God be known, * when he shall protect her.<br />
<span class="w">47:5</span>  For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves: * they gathered together.<br />
<span class="w">47:6</span>  So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were moved: * trembling took hold of them.<br />
<span class="w">47:7</span>  There were pains as of a woman in labour; * with a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis.<br />
<span class="w">47:9</span>  As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: * God hath founded it for ever.<br />
<span class="w">47:10</span>  We have received thy mercy, O God, * in the midst of thy temple.<br />
<span class="w">47:11</span>  According to thy name, O God, so also is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: * thy right hand is full of justice.<br />
<span class="w">47:12</span>  Let mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Juda be glad; * because of thy judgments, O Lord.<br />
<span class="w">47:13</span>  Surround Sion, and encompass her: * tell ye in her towers.<br />
<span class="w">47:14</span>  Set your hearts on her strength; and distribute her houses, * that ye may relate it in another generation.<br />
<span class="w">47:15</span>  For this is God, our God unto eternity, and for ever and ever: * he shall rule us for evermore.<br />

<span class="w">67:3</span>  As smoke vanisheth, so let them vanish away: * as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.<br />
<span class="w">67:4</span>  And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: * and be delighted with gladness.<br />
<span class="w">67:5</span> Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name, * make a way for him who ascendeth upon the west: <span class="w">(bow head)</span> The Lord is his name.<br />
<span class="w">67:5</span>  Rejoice ye before him: * but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence, who is the father of orphans, and the judge of widows.<br />
<span class="w">67:6</span>  God in his holy place: * God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house:<br />
<span class="w">67:7</span>  Who bringeth out them that were bound in strength; * in like manner them that provoke, that dwell in sepulchres.<br />
<span class="w">67:8</span>  O God, when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people, * when thou didst pass through the desert:<br />
<span class="w">67:9</span>  The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the presence of the God of Sinai, * at the presence of the God of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">67:10</span>  Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain, * O God: and it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect.<br />
<span class="w">67:11</span>  In it shall thy animals dwell; * in thy sweetness, O God, thou hast provided for the poor.<br />
<span class="w">67:12</span>  The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings, * with great power.<br />
<span class="w">67:13</span>  The king of powers is of the beloved, * of the beloved; and the beauty of the house shall divide spoils.<br />
<span class="w">67:14</span>  If you sleep among the midst of lots, you shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, * and the hinder parts of her back with the paleness of gold.<br />
<span class="w">67:15</span>  When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, * they shall be whited with snow in Selmon.<br />
<span class="w">67:16</span>  The mountain of God is a fat mountain, a curdled mountain, a fat mountain; * Why suspect, ye curdled mountains?<br />
<span class="w">67:17</span>  A mountain in which God is well pleased to dwell: * for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end.<br />
<span class="w">67:18</span>  The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands; thousands of them that rejoice: * the Lord is among them in Sinai, in the holy place.<br />
<span class="w">67:19</span>  Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; * thou hast received gifts in men.<br />
<span class="w">67:19</span>  Yea for those also that do not believe, * the dwelling of the Lord God.<br />
<span class="w">67:20</span>  Blessed be the Lord day by day: * the God of our salvation will make our journey prosperous to us.<br />
<span class="w">67:21</span>  Our God is the God of salvation: * and of the Lord, of the Lord are the issues from death.<br />
<span class="w">67:22</span>  But God shall break the heads of his enemies: * the hairy crown of them that walk on in their sins.<br />
<span class="w">67:23</span>  The Lord said: I will turn them from Basan, * I will turn them into the depth of the sea:<br />
<span class="w">67:24</span>  That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies; * the tongue of thy dogs be red with the same.<br />

<span class="w">67:33</span>  Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth: * sing ye to the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">67:34</span>  Sing ye to God, who mounteth above the heaven of heavens, * to the east.<br />

Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 6:44-52</span><br />
At that time, Jesus said unto the multitudes of the Jews: No man can come to Me, except the Father, Which hath sent me, draw him. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo.<br />
<span class="ri">26th Tract on John.</span><br />
Think not that thou art drawn against thy will; the soul is drawn, not willingly only, but lovingly. Neither must we be afraid lest men who are great weighers of words, and very far from understanding the things of God, should catch us up upon this Gospel doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, and should say to us: How can my faith be willing if am drawn? I answer: Thou art not drawn as touching thy will, but by pleasure. And, now, what is being drawn by pleasure? Delight thyself in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart. <span class="w">Ps. xxxvi. 4.</span> There is pleasure in that heart to which the Bread That came down from heaven is sweet. The poet is allowed to say His special pleasure draweth each, but pleasure, which so draweth, is not a necessity, not a bond, but a delight how much more strongly, may we say that men are drawn to Christ, who delight in truth, who delight in blessedness, who delight in righteousness, who delight in life everlasting, since truth and blessedness, and righteousness and everlasting life are all to be found in Christ? Or have the bodily senses pleasure, and the spiritual senses none? If the spiritual sense have no pleasures, wherefore is it written: And the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house, and Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life, and in thy light shall we see light. <span class="w">Ps. xxxv. 8.</span><br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Lord taught them good judgment and knowledge, Alleluia. He established in them the grace of His Spirit,<br />
* And filled their hearts with understanding. Alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For with a sudden sound the Holy Ghost came upon them.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And filled their hearts with understanding. Alleluia.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />

Give me a lover, and he will catch my meaning; give me one who longs, give me an hungerer, give me a wanderer in this desert, a thirst and gasping for the fountains of the eternal Fatherland; give me such an one, and he will catch my meaning. If I talk to some cold creature, he will not. Such cold creatures were they of whom it is written: The Jews then murmured at Him because He said, I am the Bread Which came down from heaven. And they said: Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and Mother we know? How is it then that He saith: I came down from heaven? Jesus therefore answered and said unto them: Murmur not among yourselves. No man can come to Me, except the Father, Which hath sent Me, draw him. <span class="w">41-44.</span> But wherefore speaketh Christ of them whom the Father draweth, since He Himself draweth. Why was it His will to say: No man can come to Me except the Father draw him? If we are to be drawn, let us be drawn by Him to Whom one that loved much said: Draw me, we will run after the savour of thy good ointments. <span class="w">Cant. i. 4.</span> But let us consider, my brethren, what He meant, and understand it as well as we can. The Father draweth to the Son them who believe in the Son, because they are persuaded that He hath God to His Father. God the Father begetteth to Himself a coequal Son; and whosoever is persuaded, and realiseth unto himself by faith, and thinketh, that He in Whom he believeth is equal to the Father, him the Father is drawing unto the Son.<br />

Arius, who believed that the Son was made, was not one of them whom the Father draweth since whosoever believeth not that the Father is a Father by the begetting of a coequal Son, such an one knoweth not the Father. What sayest thou, O Arius? What sayest thou, O thou heretic? What is thy profession? What is Christ? He is not, saith Arius, Himself Very God. Then, O Arius, the Father hath not drawn thee; thou hast not understood His dignity as a Father, to Whom thou deniest His Son. Thou dost deny the existence of the Son of God, the Father draweth thee not, and thou art not drawn to the Son, since the Son of whom thou speakest is another son, [existing only in thine imagination,] and not the really existent Son. Photinus said: Christ is a mere man, and not God at all. He who uttered those words was not one of them whom the Father draweth. But whom hath the Father drawn? The Father drew him who said: Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. <span class="w">Matth. xvi. 16, 17.</span> Show a sheep a green bough, and thou drawest him. Let a boy see some nuts, and he is drawn by them. As they run, they are drawn, drawn by taste, drawn without bodily hurt, drawn by a line bound to their heart. If, then, among earthly things, such as be sweet and pleasant draw such as love them, as soon as they see them, so that it is truth to say, His special pleasure draweth each, doth not that Christ, Whom the Father hath revealed, draw? What stronger object of love can a soul have than the Truth?<br />
