<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Acts 2:1-2</span><br />
<i class="a">W</i>hen the day of Pentecost was fully come, the disciples were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">R</i>ound roll the weeks our hearts to greet,<br />
With blissful joy returning;<br />
For lo! the Holy Paraclete<br />
On twelve bright brows sits burning:<br />
 <br />
With quivering flame he lights on each,<br />
In fashion like a tongue, to teach<br />
That eloquent they are of speech,<br />
Their hearts with true love yearning.<br />
 <br />
While with all tongues they speak to all,<br />
The nations deem them maddened,<br />
And drunk with wine the prophets call,<br />
Whom God's good Spirit gladdened;<br />
 <br />
A marvel this—in mystery done—<br />
The holy paschaltide outrun,<br />
By numbers told, whose reckoning won<br />
Remission for the saddened.<br />
 <br />
O God most Holy, thee we pray,<br />
With reverent brow low bending,<br />
Grant us the Spirit's gifts today<br />
The gifts from heaven descending;<br />
 <br />
And, since, thy grace hath deigned to bide<br />
Within our breasts once sanctified,<br />
Deign, Lord, to cast our sins aside,<br />
Henceforth calm seasons sending.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father, laud and praise,<br />
Praise to the Son be given;<br />
Praise to the Spirit of all grace,<br />
The fount of graces seven—<br />
 <br />
As was of old, all worlds before,<br />
Is now and shall be evermore,<br />
When time and change are spent and o'er<br />
All praise in earth and heaven.<br />
Amen.<br />
