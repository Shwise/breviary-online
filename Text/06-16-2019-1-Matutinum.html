<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of the season}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> God, by whose command is swayed<br />
This ordered world which thou hast made;<br />
Parent of heavenly clemency,<br />
In nature One, in persons Three;<br />
 <br />
Assist us while our minds we raise,<br />
Inflamed with thy immortal praise;<br />
That with our sober thoughts, we may<br />
Forever our thanksgiving pay.<br />
 <br />
May age by age thy wonders tell,<br />
Eternal praise thy works reveal,<br />
And sing with the celestial host<br />
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br />
Amen.<br />

From the Book on the Faith, addressed to Peter by St. Fulgentius, Bishop [of Ruspa.]<br />
<span class="ri">Found in the Works of Augustine, tom 3.</span><br />
The Faith which the holy Patriarchs and Prophets received from God before His Son was made Flesh, the Faith which the holy Apostles heard from the Lord Himself when Present in the Flesh, the Faith which the same Apostles learnt by the teaching of the Holy Ghost not only to preach by word of mouth, but also to leave behind them in their writings for the healthful instruction of all that should come after, that Faith teacheth that the Trinity, that is to say, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, is but One God. But we could not truly call the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost a Trinity, if One and the Selfsame Person were named Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Who is so great a God as our God?<br />
* Thou art the God that doest wonders.<br />

Nor if as the Being of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost is One Being, so were there but One Person, then were it untrue to say that God is a Trinity. On the other hand, if, as the Persons of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are distinguished One from Another by that which is proper to Each, so were They diverse by difference of nature, then were it untrue to say that God is One. But since concerning the nature of the One True God, Who is a Trinity, it is the Truth to say that God is One, and the Truth to say that God is a Trinity, therefore the True God is a Trinity in Persons, and an Unity in nature.<br />

Through this Oneness of nature All That the Father is is in the Son and the Holy Ghost, All That the Son is is in the Father and the Holy Ghost, and All That the Holy Ghost is is in the Father and the Son. Of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, None is without Other, None is before Other, None is Greater than Other, None is Mightier than Other. The Father, as touching the One Divine Nature, is neither before nor greater than the Son and the Holy Ghost neither is it possible that the Eternity and Infinity of the Son, whether as before or greater, should be before or greater than the Eternity and Infinity of the Spirit.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to St. Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 28:18-20</span><br />
At that time, Jesus said unto His disciples: All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Gregory of Nazianzus, Patriarch of Constantinople.<br />
<span class="ri">Treatise on the Faith.</span><br />
There is no Catholic but knoweth that the Father is a Very Father, the Son a Very Son, and the Holy Ghost a Very Holy Ghost, even as the Lord Himself saith unto His Apostles: "Go ye and baptize all nations in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." This is that Perfect Trinity Who is but One being, and of Whom therefore we testify that His Substance is one. For we make no division in God, as divisions are made in bodies, but we testify, that, according to the power of the Divine Nature, Which standeth not in matter, the Persons named have a real existence, and that God is One.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> Bless we the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.<br />
* Let us praise and exalt Him above all for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Blessed art Thou, O Lord, in the firmament of heaven, and above all to be praised and glorified for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Let us praise and exalt Him above all for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

<b>Reading 8</b><br />
We do not say, as some have dreamt, that the Begetting of the Son of God is an outgrowing from one part to another part neither do we say that He is the Word in the sense of a mere sound uttered by a voice, but we do believe that these three Names and the Persons meant by them are all of only One Being, One Majesty, and One Power. And therefore we testify that God is one, because this One-ness of His Majesty forbiddeth that we should use the Plural form of speech and say, "Gods."<br />

<b>Reading 9</b><br />
It is Catholic language to say, "Father and Son," but we cannot and must not say that the Father and the Son are two gods. And that, not because the Son of God is not by Himself God yea, He is Very God of Very God but because we know that the Son of God is not from elsewhere, but from the One Father Himself, and therefore we say that God is ONE. This is the doctrine which Prophets and Apostles have delivered this is the doctrine which the Lord Himself taught when He said: "I and the Father are One,” <span class="w">John x. 30,</span> that is, He meant, as touching the one Divine Being, but as touching Persons, We are distinct.<br />
