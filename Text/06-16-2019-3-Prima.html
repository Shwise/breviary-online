<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 53</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">53:3</span>  Save me, O God, by thy name, * and judge me in thy strength.<br />
<span class="w">53:4</span>  O God, hear my prayer: * give ear to the words of my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">53:5</span>  For strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul: * and they have not set God before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">53:6</span>  For behold God is my helper: * and the Lord is the protector of my soul.<br />
<span class="w">53:7</span>  Turn back the evils upon my enemies; * and cut them off in thy truth.<br />
<span class="w">53:8</span>  I will freely sacrifice to thee, * and will give praise, O God, to thy name: because it is good:<br />
<span class="w">53:9</span>  For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble: * and my eye hath looked down upon my enemies.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 118(1-16)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">118:1</span>  <span class="w">(Aleph)</span> Blessed are the undefiled in the way, * who walk in the law of the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">118:2</span>  Blessed are they that search his testimonies: * that seek him with their whole heart.<br />
<span class="w">118:3</span>  For they that work iniquity, * have not walked in his ways.<br />

<span class="w">118:18</span>  Open thou my eyes: * and I will consider the wondrous things of thy law.<br />
<span class="w">118:19</span>  I am a sojourner on the earth: * hide not thy commandments from me.<br />
<span class="w">118:20</span>  My soul hath coveted to long for thy justifications, * at all times.<br />
<span class="w">118:21</span>  Thou hast rebuked the proud: * they are cursed who decline from thy commandments.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Canticum Quicumque</span><em> [4]</em><br />
 <span class="w">(Canticum Quicumque * Symbolum Athanasium)</span> <br />
  Whosoever willeth to be saved, * before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholic faith.<br />
  Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, * without doubt he shall perish eternally.<br />
  Now the Catholic faith is this, * that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity.<br />
  Neither confounding the Persons, * nor dividing the substance.<br />
  For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, * and another of the Holy Ghost.<br />
  But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is one, * the Glory Equal, the Majesty Co-Eternal.<br />
  Such as the Father is, such is the Son, * and such is the Holy Ghost.<br />
  The Father Uncreated, the Son Uncreated, * and the Holy Ghost Uncreated.<br />
  The Father Infinite, the Son Infinite, * and the Holy Ghost Infinite. * The Father Eternal, the Son Eternal, * and the Holy Ghost Eternal.<br />
  And yet they are not three Eternals, * but one Eternal.<br />
  As also they are not three Uncreated, nor three Infinites, * but One Uncreated, and One Infinite.<br />
  So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, * and the Holy Ghost Almighty.<br />
  And yet they are not three Almighties, * but One Almighty.<br />
  So the Father is God, the Son God, * and the Holy Ghost God.<br />
  And yet they are not three Gods, * but One God.<br />
  So the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, * and the Holy Ghost Lord.<br />
  And yet they are not three Lords, * but One Lord.<br />
  For, like as we are compelled by Christian truth to acknowledge every Person by Himself to be God and Lord, * so are we forbidden by the Catholic Religion to say, there be three Gods or three Lords.<br />
  The Father is made of none, * neither created, nor begotten.<br />
  The Son is of the Father alone: * not made, nor created, but begotten.<br />
  The Holy Ghost is of the Father, and the Son: * not made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.<br />
  So there is One Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; * one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.<br />
  And in this Trinity is nothing afore or after, nothing is greater or less; * but the whole three Persons are Co-Eternal together, and Co-Equal.<br />
  So that in all things, as is aforesaid, * the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.<br />
  He therefore that willeth to be safe, * let him thus think of the Trinity.<br />
  But it is necessary to eternal salvation, * that he also believe faithfully the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
  The right Faith therefore is, that we believe and confess, * that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.<br />
  God, of the Substance of the Father, Begotten before the worlds: * and Man, of the substance of His mother, born in the world.<br />
  Perfect God, Perfect Man, * of a reasoning soul and human flesh subsisting.<br />
  Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, * inferior to the Father as touching His Manhood.<br />
  Who, although He be God and Man, * yet He is not two, but One Christ.<br />
  One, however, not by conversion of the Godhead into Flesh, * but by taking of the Manhood into God.<br />
  One altogether, not by confusion of Substance, * but by Unity of Person.<br />
  For as the reasoning soul and flesh is one man, * so God and man is One Christ.<br />
  Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, * rose again the third day from the dead.<br />
  He ascended into heaven, He sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty, * from whence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.<br />
  At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies, * and shall give account for their own works.<br />
  And they that have done good shall go into life eternal, * but they that have done evil into eternal fire.<br />
  This is the Catholic Faith, * which except a man believe faithfully and firmly, he cannot be safe.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Glory be to thee, O equal Trinity one Deity, from before all ages, so now and for evermore.<br />
