<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> For thy mercy, * O Lord, is before my eyes; and I am well pleased with thy truth.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 25</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">25:1</span>  Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my innocence: * and I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall not be weakened.<br />
<span class="w">25:2</span>  Prove me, O Lord, and try me; * burn my reins and my heart.<br />
<span class="w">25:3</span>  For thy mercy is before my eyes; * and I am well pleased with thy truth.<br />
<span class="w">25:4</span>  I have not sat with the council of vanity: * neither will I go in with the doers of unjust things.<br />
<span class="w">25:5</span>  I have hated the assembly of the malignant; * and with the wicked I will not sit.<br />
<span class="w">25:6</span>  I will wash my hands among the innocent; * and will compass thy altar, O Lord:<br />
<span class="w">25:7</span>  That I may hear the voice of thy praise: * and tell of all thy wondrous works.<br />
<span class="w">25:8</span>  I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of thy house; * and the place where thy glory dwelleth.<br />
<span class="w">25:9</span>  Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked: * nor my life with bloody men:<br />
<span class="w">25:10</span>  In whose hands are iniquities: * their right hand is filled with gifts.<br />
<span class="w">25:11</span>  But as for me, I have walked in my innocence: * redeem me, and have mercy on me.<br />
<span class="w">25:12</span>  My foot hath stood in the direct way: * in the churches I will bless thee, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 51</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">51:3</span>  Why dost thou glory in malice, * thou that art mighty in iniquity?<br />
<span class="w">51:4</span>  All the day long thy tongue hath devised injustice: * as a sharp razor, thou hast wrought deceit.<br />
<span class="w">51:5</span>  Thou hast loved malice more than goodness: * and iniquity rather than to speak righteousness.<br />
<span class="w">51:6</span>  Thou hast loved all the words of ruin, * O deceitful tongue.<br />
<span class="w">51:7</span>  Therefore will God destroy thee for ever: * he will pluck thee out, and remove thee from thy dwelling place: and thy root out of the land of the living.<br />
<span class="w">51:8</span>  The just shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say: * Behold the man that made not God his helper:<br />
<span class="w">51:9</span>  But trusted in the abundance of his riches: * and prevailed in his vanity.<br />
<span class="w">51:10</span>  But I, as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, * have hoped in the mercy of God for ever, yea for ever and ever.<br />
<span class="w">51:11</span>  I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: * and I will wait on thy name, for it is good in the sight of thy saints.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 52</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">52:1</span>  The fool said in his heart: * There is no God.<br />
<span class="w">52:2</span>  They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: * there is none that doth good.<br />
<span class="w">52:3</span>  God looked down from heaven on the children of men: * to see if there were any that did understand, or did seek God.<br />
<span class="w">52:4</span>  All have gone aside, they are become unprofitable together, * there is none that doth good, no not one.<br />
<span class="w">52:5</span>  Shall not all the workers of iniquity know, * who eat up my people as they eat bread?<br />
<span class="w">52:6</span>  They have not called upon God: * there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.<br />
<span class="w">52:6</span>  For God hath scattered the bones of them that please men: * they have been confounded, because God hath despised them.<br />
<span class="w">52:7</span>  Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? * when God shall bring back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
