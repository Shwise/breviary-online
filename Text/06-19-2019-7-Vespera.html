<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Proper of the season}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">1 Cor 11:23-24</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>rothers: For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">S</i>ing, my tongue, the Saviour's glory,<br />
Of his flesh the mystery sing;<br />
Of the blood, all price exceeding,<br />
Shed by our immortal King,<br />
Destined, for the world's redemption,<br />
From a noble womb to spring.<br />
 <br />
Of a pure and spotless Virgin<br />
Born for us on earth below,<br />
He, as man, with man conversing,<br />
Stayed, the seeds of truth to sow;<br />
Then he closed in solemn order<br />
Wondrously his life of woe.<br />
 <br />
On the night of that last supper<br />
Seated with his chosen band,<br />
He, the paschal victim eating,<br />
First fulfills the law's command:<br />
Then as food to all his brethren<br />
Gives himself with his own hand.<br />
 <br />
Word made flesh, the bread of nature<br />
By his word to flesh he turns;<br />
Wine into his blood he changes:<br />
What though sense no change discerns?<br />
Only be the heart in earnest,<br />
Faith her lesson quickly learns.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">If the Office is celebrated before the exposed Blessed Sacrament, the following verses are said on bended knee.</span><br />
 <br />
Down in adoration falling,<br />
Lo! the sacred Host we hail;<br />
Lo! o'er ancient forms departing,<br />
Newer rites of grace prevail;<br />
Faith for all defects supplying,<br />
Where the feeble senses fail.<br />
 <br />
To the everlasting Father,<br />
And the Son who reigns on high,<br />
With the Holy Ghost proceeding<br />
Forth from each eternally,<br />
Be salvation, honour, blessing,<br />
Might, and endless majesty.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, how kindly is thy Spirit; * even thine, Whose sustenance declared thy sweetness unto thy children when Thou didst send them from heaven bread tempering itself to every man's liking. O Thou, Who hast filled the hungry with good things, and the rich, that are proud in the imagination of their hearts, Thou hast sent empty away.<br />

<span class="w">1:47</span> And my spirit hath rejoiced * in God my Saviour.<br />

<span class="w">1:50</span> And his mercy is from generation unto generations, * to them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">1:51</span> He hath shewed might in his arm: * he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.<br />
<span class="w">1:52</span> He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble.<br />
<span class="w">1:53</span> He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
<span class="w">1:54</span> He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy:<br />
<span class="w">1:55</span> As he spoke to our fathers, * to Abraham and to his seed for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
