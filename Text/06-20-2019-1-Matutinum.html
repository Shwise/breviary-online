<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of the season}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">A</i>t this our solemn feast,<br />
Let holy joys abound,<br />
And from the inmost breast<br />
Let songs of praise resound;<br />
Let ancient rites depart,<br />
And all be new around,<br />
In ev'ry act and voice and heart.<br />
 <br />
Remember we that eve,<br />
When, the last supper spread,<br />
Christ, as we all believe,<br />
The lamb, with leavenless bread,<br />
Among his brethren shared,<br />
And thus the law obeyed,<br />
Of old unto their sires declared.<br />
 <br />
The typic lamb consumed,<br />
The legal feast complete,<br />
The Lord unto the twelve<br />
His body gave to eat;<br />
The whole to all, no less<br />
The whole to each, did mete<br />
With his own hands, as we confess.<br />
 <br />
He gave them, weak and frail,<br />
His flesh, their food to be;<br />
On them, downcast and sad,<br />
His blood bestowèd he:<br />
And thus to them he spake,<br />
“Receive this cup from me,<br />
And all of you of this partake.”<br />
 <br />
So he this sacrifice<br />
To institute did will,<br />
And charged his priests alone<br />
That office to fulfil:<br />
In them he did confide:<br />
To whom pertaineth still<br />
To take, and to the rest divide.<br />
 <br />
Thus angels' bread is made<br />
The bread of man today:<br />
The living bread from heaven<br />
With figures doth away:<br />
O wondrous gift indeed!<br />
The poor and lowly may<br />
Upon their Lord and Master feed.<br />
 <br />
O Triune Deity,<br />
To thee we meekly pray,<br />
So mayst thou visit us,<br />
As we our homage pay;<br />
And in thy footsteps bright<br />
Conduct us on our way<br />
To where thou dwell'st in cloudless light.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">15:1</span>  Preserve me, O Lord, for I have put my trust in thee. * I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of my goods.<br />
<span class="w">15:3</span>  To the saints, who are in his land, * he hath made wonderful all my desires in them.<br />

From the Sermons of St. Thomas Aquinas.<br />
<span class="ri">17th or 57th of his Opuscula, or Lesser Works.</span><br />
The immeasurable benefits, which the goodness of God hath bestowed on Christian people, have conferred on them also a dignity beyond all price. "For what nation is there so great, who hath gods so nigh unto them, as the Lord, our God, is unto us?" <span class="w">Deut. iv. 7.</span> The Only-begotten Son of God, being pleased to make us "partakers of the Divine nature," <span class="w">2 Pet. i. 4,</span> took our nature upon Him, being Himself made Man that He might make men gods. And all, as much of ours as He took, He applied to our salvation. On the Altar of the Cross He offered up His Body to God the Father as a sacrifice for our reconciliation He shed His Blood as the price whereby He redeemeth us from wretchedness and bondage, and the washing whereby He cleanseth us from all sin. And for a noble and abiding memorial of that so great work of His goodness, He hath left unto His faithful ones the Same His very Body for Meat, and the Same His very Blood for Drink, to be fed upon under the appearance of bread and wine.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

How precious a thing then, how marvelous, how health-giving, how furnished with all dainties, is the Supper [of the Lord!] Than His Supper can anything be more precious? Therein there is put before us for meat, not, as of old time, the flesh of bulls and of goats, but Christ Himself, our very God. Than this Sacrament can anything be more marvelous? Therein it cometh to pass that bread and wine are bread and wine no more, but in the stead thereof there is the Body and there is the Blood of Christ; that is to say, Christ Himself, Perfect God and Perfect Man, Christ Himself is there, under the appearance of a little bread and wine. His faithful ones eat Him, but He is not mangled; nay, when [the veil which shroudeth Him in] this Sacrament is broken, in each broken piece thereof remaineth whole Christ Himself, Perfect God and Perfect Man. All that the senses can reach in this Sacrament, [look, taste, feel, smell, and the like, all these] abide of bread and wine, but the Thing is not bread and wine. And thus room is left for faith; Christ Who hath a Form That can be seen, is here taken and received not only unseen, but seeming to be bread and wine, and the senses, which judge by the wonted look, are warranted against error.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

Than this Sacrament can anything be more health-giving? Thereby are sins purged away, strength renewed, and the soul fed upon the fatness of spiritual gifts. This Supper is offered up in the Church both for the quick and dead it was ordained to the health of all, all get the good of it. Than this Sacrament can anything be more furnished with dainties The glorious sweetness thereof is of a truth such that no man can fully tell it. Therein ghostly comfort is sucked from its very well-head. Therein a memorial is made of that exceeding great love which Christ showed in time of His sufferings. It was in order that the boundless goodness of that His great love might be driven home into the hearts of His faithful ones, that when He had celebrated the Passover with His disciples, and the last Supper was ended, "the Lord Jesus, knowing that His hour was come that He should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them unto the end," <span class="w">John xiii. 1,</span> and instituted this Sacrament, this Sacrament, the everlasting "forth-showing of His death until He come again," <span class="w">1 Cor. xi. 26,</span> this Sacrament, the embodied fulfilment of all the ancient types and figures, this Sacrament, the greatest miracle which He ever wrought, and the one mighty joy of them that now have sorrow, till He shall come again, and their heart shall rejoice, and their joy no man take from them. <span class="w">John xvi. 22.</span><br />

From the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 6:56-59</span><br />
At that time: Jesus said unto the multitudes of the Jews: My Flesh is meat indeed, and My Blood is drink indeed. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo)<br />
<span class="ri">26th Tract on John.</span><br />
By use of meat and drink men would fain that "they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more," <span class="w">Apoc. vii. 16,</span> and yet there is but one Meat and one Drink, Which doth work in them that feed thereon that "this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality," <span class="w">1 Cor. xv. 53,</span> namely communion with that general assembly and Church of God's holy children, who are "kept in perfect peace," <span class="w">Isa. xxvi. 3,</span> and are "all one," <span class="w">John xvii. 11,</span> fully and utterly. And therefore it is, as men of God before our time have taken it, that our Lord Jesus Christ hath set before us His Body and His Blood in the likeness of things which, from being many, are reduced into one. In one loaf are many grains of corn, and one cup of wine the juice of many grapes. And now He giveth us to know how that which He spake cometh to pass, and how indeed "this Man can give us His Flesh to eat," and His Blood to drink.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> He that eateth My Flesh and drinketh My Blood,<br />
* Dwelleth in Me, and I in him.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> What nation is there so great, who hath gods so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is to us<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Dwelleth in Me, and I in him.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

<b>Reading 8</b><br />
"He that eateth My Flesh, and drinketh My Blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him." To dwell in Christ, therefore, and to have Him dwelling in us, is to "eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup," <span class="w">1 Cor. xi. 28,</span> and he which dwelleth not in Christ, and in whom Christ dwelleth not, without all doubt doth not spiritually eat His Flesh nor drink His Blood, although he do carnally and visibly press the Sacrament with his teeth but, contrariwise, he "eateth and drinketh damnation to himself," because he dareth to draw nigh filthy to that secret and holy thing of Christ, whereunto none draweth nigh worthily, save he which is pure, even he which is of them concerning whom it is said: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." <span class="w">Matth. v. 8.</span><br />

"As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me." This is as though He said: The Father hath sent Me into the world <span class="w">John x. 36,</span> and I have emptied Myself [and taken upon Me the form of a servant, and being found in fashion as a man], <span class="w">Phil. ii. 7, 8.</span> I have My life from the Father, as One That is greater than I. <span class="w">John xiv. 28.</span> He that eateth Me, even he, by thereby taking part in Me, shall live by Me. It is as having humbled Myself <span class="w">Phil. ii. 8</span> that I live by the Father, but he that eateth Me, him will I raise up, <span class="w">John vi. 55,</span> and so he shall live by Me. It is said "I live by the Father" that is to say, He is of the Father, not the Father of Him, and yet not so, but that the Father and the Son are co-equal together. Also it is said "So he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me," whereby He showeth the gracious work towards His people of Him Who is the "one Mediator between God and man," <span class="w">1 Tim. ii. 5,</span> and not that He Which is eaten and he which eateth Him are co-equal together.<br />
