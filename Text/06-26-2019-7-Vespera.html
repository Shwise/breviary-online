<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Wis 3:1-3</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>ut the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, but they are in peace.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">S</i>ing, O sons of the Church sounding the martyrs' praise!<br />
God's true soldiers applaud, who, in their weary days,<br />
Won bright trophies of good, glad be the voice ye raise,<br />
While these heroes of Christ ye sing!<br />
 <br />
They, while yet in the world were by the world abhorred;<br />
Felt how fading the joys, fleeting the wealth it stored;<br />
Spurned all pleasure for thee, and at thy call, O Lord,<br />
Came forth strong in thy name, as King.<br />
 <br />
Lord, how bravely they bore fury and pain for thee!<br />
Scourge, rod, sword, and the rack strongly endured; but free<br />
Sang out, bold in thy love, longing on high to be;<br />
Earth's might never their souls could bend.<br />
 <br />
While they, shedding their blood, victims for Jesus fell,<br />
No sound out of their lips came of their throes to tell;<br />
Bowed low, patient and meek, loving the Lord so well,<br />
Turned they still to the Christ, their friend.<br />
 <br />
What joys, bright with the blood shed for thy love they share,<br />
Those brave martyrs of thine crowned with thy laurels rare;<br />
Man's tongue never can tell, never can half declare,<br />
How pure now is their bliss above!<br />
 <br />
Yet we, Father on high, God of eternal might,<br />
Lift weak voices in prayer asking for peace and light;<br />
Cleanse thou out of our hearts every stain and blight,<br />
So our songs may be songs of love, Amen.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The saints shall rejoice in glory:<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They shall be joyful in their beds.<br />
<b>Canticum: Magnificat</b> <em>{Antiphon from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> These are two olive trees * and two candlesticks, giving light in the presence of the Lord these have power to shut heaven with clouds, and have power again to open the gates thereof, for their tongues are become keys of heaven.<br />

<span class="w">1:50</span> And his mercy is from generation unto generations, * to them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">1:51</span> He hath shewed might in his arm: * he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.<br />
<span class="w">1:52</span> He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble.<br />
<span class="w">1:53</span> He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
<span class="w">1:54</span> He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy:<br />
<span class="w">1:55</span> As he spoke to our fathers, * to Abraham and to his seed for ever.<br />
