<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of the season}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> Christ, the world's Creator bright,<br />
Who didst mankind from sin redeem,<br />
Light from the Father's glorious light,<br />
True God of God, in bliss supreme.<br />
 <br />
thy love compelled thee to assume<br />
A mortal body, man to save;<br />
Reversing the old Adam's doom;<br />
Our ransom the new Adam gave.<br />
 <br />
That love which gloriously framed all<br />
The earth, the stars, and wondrous sea<br />
Took pity on our parents' fall,<br />
Broke all our bonds and set us free.<br />
 <br />
O Saviour, let thy potent love<br />
Flow ever from thy bounteous heart;<br />
To nations that pure fount above<br />
The grace of pardon will impart.<br />
 <br />
His heart for this was opened wide,<br />
And wounded by the soldier's spear,<br />
That freely from his sacred side<br />
Might flow the streams our souls to clear.<br />
 <br />
Glory to Father and to Son,<br />
And to the Holy Ghost the same,<br />
To whom all power, when time is done,<br />
And endless rule, in endless fame.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 32</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">32:1</span>  Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just: * praise becometh the upright.<br />
<span class="w">32:2</span>  Give praise to the Lord on the harp; * sing to him with the psaltery, the instrument of ten strings.<br />
<span class="w">32:3</span>  Sing to him a new canticle, * sing well unto him with a loud noise.<br />
<span class="w">32:4</span>  For the word of the Lord is right, * and all his works are done with faithfulness.<br />
<span class="w">32:5</span>  He loveth mercy and judgment; * the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">32:6</span>  By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; * and all the power of them by the spirit of his mouth:<br />
<span class="w">32:7</span>  Gathering together the waters of the sea, as in a vessel; * laying up the depths in storehouses.<br />
<span class="w">32:8</span>  Let all the earth fear the Lord, * and let all the inhabitants of the world be in awe of him.<br />
<span class="w">32:9</span>  For he spoke and they were made: * he commanded and they were created.<br />
<span class="w">32:10</span>  The Lord bringeth to nought the counsels of nations; * and he rejecteth the devices of people, and casteth away the counsels of princes.<br />
<span class="w">32:11</span>  But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever: * the thoughts of his heart to all generations.<br />
<span class="w">32:12</span>  Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord: * the people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">32:13</span>  The Lord hath looked from heaven: * he hath beheld all the sons of men.<br />

<span class="w">32:15</span>  He who hath made the hearts of every one of them: * who understandeth all their works.<br />
<span class="w">32:16</span>  The king is not saved by a great army: * nor shall the giant be saved by his own great strength.<br />
<span class="w">32:17</span>  Vain is the horse for safety: * neither shall he be saved by the abundance of his strength.<br />
<span class="w">32:18</span>  Behold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him: * and on them that hope in his mercy.<br />
<span class="w">32:19</span>  To deliver their souls from death; * and feed them in famine.<br />
<span class="w">32:20</span>  Our soul waiteth for the Lord: * for he is our helper and protector.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 35</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">35:2</span>  The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin: * there is no fear of God before his eyes.<br />
<span class="w">35:3</span>  For in his sight he hath done deceitfully, * that his iniquity may be found unto hatred.<br />
<span class="w">35:4</span>  The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile: * he would not understand that he might do well.<br />
<span class="w">35:5</span>  He hath devised iniquity on his bed, * he hath set himself on every way that is not good: but evil he hath not hated.<br />
<span class="w">35:6</span>  O Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, * and thy truth reacheth even to the clouds.<br />
<span class="w">35:7</span>  Thy justice is as the mountains of God, * thy judgments are a great deep.<br />
<span class="w">35:7</span>  Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord: * O how hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God!<br />
<span class="w">35:8</span>  But the children of men * shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings.<br />
<span class="w">35:9</span>  They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house; * and thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure.<br />
<span class="w">35:10</span>  For with thee is the fountain of life; * and in thy light we shall see light.<br />
<span class="w">35:11</span>  Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, * and thy justice to them that are right in heart.<br />
<span class="w">35:12</span>  Let not the foot of pride come to me, * and let not the hand of the sinner move me.<br />
<span class="w">35:13</span>  There the workers of iniquity are fallen, * they are cast out, and could not stand.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 40</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">40:2</span>  Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the poor: * the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.<br />

<span class="w">40:4</span>  The Lord help him on his bed of sorrow: * thou hast turned all his couch in his sickness.<br />
<span class="w">40:5</span>  I said: O Lord, be thou merciful to me: * heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.<br />
<span class="w">40:6</span>  My enemies have spoken evils against me: * when shall he die and his name perish?<br />
<span class="w">40:7</span>  And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things: * his heart gathered together iniquity to itself.<br />
<span class="w">40:7</span>  He went out * and spoke to the same purpose.<br />
<span class="w">40:8</span>  All my enemies whispered together against me: * they devised evils to me.<br />
<span class="w">40:9</span>  They determined against me an unjust word: * shall he that sleepeth rise again no more?<br />
<span class="w">40:10</span>  For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, * who ate my bread, hath greatly supplanted me.<br />
<span class="w">40:11</span>  But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again: * and I will requite them.<br />
<span class="w">40:12</span>  By this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me: * because my enemy shall not rejoice over me.<br />

<span class="ri">From the Encyclical Letter of Pope Pius XI</span><br />
Among the wonderful developments of sacred teaching and piety, by which the plans of the divine Wisdom are daily made clear to the Church, hardly any is more manifest than the triumphant progress made by the devotion of the most Sacred Heart of Jesus. Very often indeed, during the course of past ages, Fathers, Doctors, and Saints have celebrated our Redeemer's love: and they have said, that the wound opened in the side of Christ was the hidden fountain of all graces. Moreover, from the Middle Ages onward, when the faithful began to show a more tender piety towards the most sacred Humanity of the Saviour, contemplative souls became accustomed to penetrate through that wound almost to the very Heart itself, wounded for the love of men. And from that time, this form of contemplation became so familiar to all persons of saintly life, that there was no country or religious order in which, during this period, witnesses to it were not to be found. Finally, during recent centuries, and most especially at that period when heretics, in the name of a false piety, strove to discourage Christians from receiving the most Holy Eucharist, the veneration of the most Sacred Heart began to be openly practised, principally through the exertions of St. John Eudes, who is by no means unworthily called the founder of the liturgical worship of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him,<br />
* Yea, unto all such as call upon him faithfully.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The Lord is full of compassion and mercy, long-suffering and of great goodness.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Yea, unto all such as call upon him faithfully.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May Christ to all His people give, for ever in His sight to live. Amen.<br />

But in order to establish fully and entirely the worship of the most Sacred Heart of Jesus, and to spread the same throughout the whole world, God himself chose as his instrument a most humble virgin from the order of the Visitation, St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, who even in her earliest years already had a burning love for the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and to whom Christ the Lord had very many times appeared, and was pleased to make known the riches and the desires of his divine Heart. The most famous of these apparitions was that in which Jesus revealed himself to her in prayer before the blessed Sacrament, shewed her his most Sacred Heart, and, complaining that in return for his unbounded love, he met with nothing but outrages and ingratitude from mankind, he ordered her to concern herself with the establishment of a new feast, on the Friday after the Octave of Corpus Christi, on which his Heart should be venerated with due honour, and that the insults offered him by sinners in the Sacrament of love should be expiated by worthy satisfaction. But there is no one who knoweth not how many and how great were the obstacles which the handmaid of God experienced, in carrying out the commands of Christ; but, endowed with strength by the Lord himself, and actively aided by her pious spiritual directors, who exerted themselves with an almost unbelievable zeal, up to the time of her death she never ceased faithfully to carry out the duty entrusted to her by heaven.<br />

<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Spirit's fire Divine in our hearts enkindled shine. Amen. <br />

At length, in the year 1765, the Supreme Pontiff Clement XIII approved the Mass and Office in honour of the most Sacred Heart of Jesus; and Pius IX extended the feast to the universal Church. From then on the worship of the most Sacred Heart, like an overflowing river, washing away all obstacles, hath poured itself forth over all the earth, and, at the dawn of the new century, Leo XIII, having proclaimed a jubilee, decided to dedicate the whole human race to the most Sacred Heart. This consecration was actually carried out with solemn rites in all the churches of the Catholic world, and brought about a great increase of this devotion, leading not only nations but even private families to it, who in countless numbers dedicated themselves to the Divine Heart, and submitted themselves to its royal sway. Lastly, the Sovereign Pontiff Pius XI, in order that, by its solemnity, the feast might answer more fully to the greatly widespread devotion of the Christian people, raised the feast of the most Sacred Heart of Jesus to the rite of a double of the first class, with an octave; and moreover, that the violated rights of Christ, the supreme King and most loving Lord, might be repaired, and that the sins of the nations might be bewailed, he ordered that annually, on that same feast-day, there should be recited an expiatory form of prayer in all the churches of the Christian world.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 19:31-37</span><br />
At that time: The Jews, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath Day, for that Sabbath Day was an high day, besought Pilate that their legs might broken, and that they might be taken away. And so on.<br />
 <br />
A Homily by St. Bonaventure the Bishop<br />
<span class="ri">Book of the Tree of Life, num. 30</span><br />
In order that the Church might be taken out of the side of Christ, in his deep sleep on the Cross, and that the Scripture might be fulfilled which saith: They shall look on him whom they pierced: it was divinely ordained that one of the soldiers should pierce his sacred side with a spear, and open it. Then forthwith there came flowing out blood and water, which was the price of our salvation, pouring forth from its mountain-source, in sooth, from the secret places of his Heart, to give power to the Sacraments of the Church, to bestow the life of grace, and to be as a saving drink of living waters, flowing up to life eternal for those who were already quickened in Christ. Arise, then, O soul beloved of Christ. Cease not thy vigilance, place there thy lips, and drink the waters from the fount of salvation.<br />

Because we are now come to the sweet Heart of Jesus, and because it is good for us to be here, let us not too soon turn away therefrom. O how good and joyful a thing it is to dwell in this Heart. What a good treasure, what a precious pearl, is thy Heart, O most excellent Jesu, which we have found hidden in the pit which hath been dug in this field, namely, in thy body. Who would cast away such a pearl? Nay, rather, for this same I would give all my pearls. I will sell all my thoughts and affections, and buy the same for myself, turning all my thoughts to the Heart of the good Jesus, and without fail it will support me. Therefore, o most sweet Jesu, finding this Heart that is thine and mine, I will pray to thee, my God: admit my prayers into the shrine of hearkening: and draw me even more altogether into thy Heart.<br />

For to this end was thy side pierced, that an entry might be open unto us. To this end was thy Heart wounded, that in it we might be able to dwell secure from alarms from without. And it was wounded none the less on this account that, because of the visible wound, we may perceive the wound of love which is invisible. How could this fire of love better shine forth than for him to permit that not only his body, but that even his Heart, should be wounded with the spear? Who would not love that Heart so wounded? Who would not, in return, love one who is so loving? Who would not embrace one so chaste? Wherefore let us who are in the flesh love in return, as much as we can, him who so loveth, embrace our wounded one, whose hands and feet, side and Heart, have been pierced by wicked husbandmen; and let us pray that he may deign to bind our hearts, still hard and impenitent, with the chain of his love, and wound them with the dart thereof.<br />
