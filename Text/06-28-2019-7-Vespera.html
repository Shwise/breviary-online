<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Proper of the season}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Eph 3:8-9</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>rethren: Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the Mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">L</i>o, how the savage crew<br />
Of our proud sins hath rent<br />
The heart of our all-gracious God,<br />
That heart so innocent.<br />
 <br />
The soldier's quivering lance<br />
Our guilt it was that drave,<br />
Our wicked deeds that to its point<br />
Such cruel sharpness gave.<br />
 <br />
O wounded heart, whence sprang<br />
The Church, the Saviour's bride;<br />
Thou door of our salvation's ark<br />
Set in its mystic side.<br />
 <br />
Thou holy fount, whence flows<br />
The sacred sevenfold flood,<br />
Where we our filthy robes may cleanse<br />
In the Lamb's saving blood:<br />
 <br />
By sorrowful relapse,<br />
thee will we rend no more;<br />
But like the flames, those types of love,<br />
Strive heavenward to soar.<br />
 <br />
Father and Son supreme<br />
And Spirit, hear our cry;<br />
Whose is the kingdom, praise and power,<br />
Through all eternity.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> With joy shall ye draw water.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Out of the fountains of the Saviour.<br />

<span class="w">1:47</span> And my spirit hath rejoiced * in God my Saviour.<br />
<span class="w">1:48</span> Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; * for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.<br />

<span class="w">1:50</span> And his mercy is from generation unto generations, * to them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">1:51</span> He hath shewed might in his arm: * he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.<br />
<span class="w">1:52</span> He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble.<br />
<span class="w">1:53</span> He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
<span class="w">1:54</span> He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy:<br />
<span class="w">1:55</span> As he spoke to our fathers, * to Abraham and to his seed for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
