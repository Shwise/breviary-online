<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">H</i>e who once, in righteous vengeance,<br />
Whelmed the world beneath the flood,<br />
Once again in mercy cleansed it<br />
With the stream of his own blood,<br />
Coming from his throne on high<br />
On the painful cross to die.<br />
 <br />
Blest with this all-saving shower,<br />
Earth her beauty straight resumed;<br />
In the place of thorns and briars,<br />
Myrtles sprang, and roses bloomed:<br />
Bitter wormwood of the waste<br />
Into honey changed its taste.<br />
 <br />
Scorpions ceased; the slimy serpent<br />
Laid his deadly poison by;<br />
Savage beasts of cruel instinct<br />
Lost their wild ferocity;<br />
Welcoming the gentle reign<br />
Of the Lamb for sinners slain.<br />
 <br />
Oh, the wisdom of th' eternal!<br />
Oh, its depth and height divine!<br />
Oh, the sweetness of that mercy<br />
Which in Jesus Christ doth shine!<br />
Slaves we were condemned to die!<br />
Our King pays the penalty!<br />
 <br />
When before the Judge we tremble,<br />
Conscious of his broken laws,<br />
May this blood, in that dread hour,<br />
Cry aloud, and plead our cause;<br />
Bid our guilty terrors cease,<br />
Be our pardon and our peace.<br />
 <br />
Prince and author of salvation!<br />
Lord of majesty supreme!<br />
Jesu, praise to thee be given<br />
By the world thou didst redeem;<br />
Who with the Father and the Spirit,<br />
Reignest in eternal merit.<br />
Amen.<br />

Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews<br />
<span class="ri">Heb 9:11-15</span><br />
<span class="w">11</span> But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:<br />
<span class="w">12</span> Neither by the blood of goats, or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the holies, having obtained eternal redemption.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh:<br />
<span class="w">14</span> How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?<br />
<span class="w">15</span> And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his death, for the redemption of those transgressions, which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own Blood, suffered without the gate.<br />
* Let us go forth therefore unto Him without the camp, bearing His reproach.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Let us go forth therefore unto Him without the gate, bearing His reproach.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Son, the Sole-begotten, mercifully bless and keep us. Amen. <br />

<b>Reading 2</b><br />
<span class="ri">Heb 9:16-22</span><br />
<span class="w">6</span> For where there is a testament, the death of the testator must of necessity come in.<br />
<span class="w">17</span> For a testament is of force, after men are dead: otherwise it is as yet of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.<br />
<span class="w">19</span> For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,<br />
<span class="w">20</span> Saying: This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined unto you.<br />
<span class="w">21</span> The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.<br />
<span class="w">22</span> And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Moses took the blood, and sprinkled all the people;<br />
* Saying: This is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined unto you.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Through faith he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the first-born should touch them.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Saying: This is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined unto you.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />

From the Sermons of St. John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople.<br />
<span class="ri">Homily 84. in John, cap. 19.</span><br />
Wouldest thou hear the power of the Blood of Christ? Then let us look at the figure thereof, let us call to mind the old type, and tell the story written in the ancient Scriptures. The Egyptians would not let God take away Israel His firstborn, And Moses said: Thus saith the Lord: About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt, and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill, and all the first-born of beasts.

The statues of monarchs, mindless and speechless images though they be, have sometimes been an helpful refuge to men endowed with soul and reason, not because they are works of the brazier's skill, but because the likeness they bear is a King's. And just so did this unconscious blood deliver the lives of men, not because it was blood, but because it foreshadowed the shedding of the Blood of Jesus. On that night in Egypt, when the destroying Angel saw the blood upon the lintel and on the two side-posts, he passed over the door, and came not in unto the house. Even so now much more will the destroyer of souls flee away when he seeth, not the lintel and the two side-posts sprinkled with the blood of a lamb, but the mouth of the faithful Christian, the living dwelling of the Holy Ghost, shining with the blood of the True Messiah. If the Angel let the type be, how shall not the enemy quail before the Reality? Wouldest thou hear more of the power of that Blood I am willing. Consider from what source it welleth, from what fountain it springeth. Its fountain is the Heart of the Lord, pierced for us upon the Cross. Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with Him but when they came to Jesus, and saw that He was dead already, they brake not His Legs, but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced His Side, and forthwith came thereout Blood and Water, <span class="w">John xix, 32-34,</span> whereof One is a figure of Baptism, and the other of the Sacrament <span class="w">of the Altar.</span> One of the soldiers with a spear pierced His Side the veil of the Temple of His Body was rent in twain. <span class="w">John ii. 19-21, Matth. xxvii. 51.</span> O how glorious is the treasure that is laid open to me therein How noble the riches that it is my joy there to have found!<br />

And so was it done concerning that Lamb: the Jews killed a sheep, and I have learned the value of the sacrament. From the Side flowed forth Blood and Water. I would not, O my hearer, that thou shouldest pass by the depths of such a mystery as this without pausing; for I have yet a mystic and mysterious discourse to deliver. I have said that the Water and Blood shewed forth symbolically baptism and the sacraments. For from these, holy Church was founded by the laver of regeneration, and the renovation of the Holy Ghost. Through baptism, I say, and through the sacraments, which seem to have issued from his Side. It was therefore out of the Side of Christ that the Church was created, just as it was out of the side of Adam that Eve was raised up to be his bride. This is the reason why Paul saith, no doubt in allusion to his Side: We are members of his Body, and of his bones. For even as God made the woman Eve out of the rib which he had taken out of the side of Adam, so hath Christ made the Church out of the Blood and Water which he made to flow for us out of his own Side. -On the occasion of the nineteenth centenary of the accomplishment of the redemption of mankind, as a fitting celebration of this ineffable blessing, Pope Pius XI decreed an extraordinary Jubilee. During that year the Supreme Pontiff, wishing that the fruits of the Precious Blood of Christ, the Lamb without spot, might redound more abundantly upon mankind and that the minds of the faithful be impressed with more vivid recollections of this same Blood as the price of their redemption, elevated the Feast of the Most Precious Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ to the rank of a double of the first class, to be celebrated as such every year by the universal Church.<br />

At that time: When Jesus had received the vinegar, He said: It is finished. And He bowed His Head, and gave up the ghost. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo.<br />
<span class="ri">120th Tract on John.</span><br />
One of the soldiers with a spear pierced His Side, and forthwith came thereout Blood and Water. The Evangelist speaketh carefully. He saith not that he smote the Side, nor yet that he wounded It, nor yet anything else, but pierced pierced It, to fling wide the entrance unto life, whence flow the Sacraments of the Church, those Sacraments without which there is no entrance unto the life which is life indeed. That Blood which was shed there was shed for the remission of sins, that Water is the water that mantleth in the cup of salvation. Therein are we washed, and thereof do we drink. Of this was it a type when it was said unto Noah: The door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof and of every living thing of all flesh shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive. <span class="w">Gen. vi. 16, 19.</span> A figure this of the Church. Thus was it that the first woman was made from the side of her husband while he slept, and she was called (Eve, which is, being interpreted,) Life, because she was the mother of all living. <span class="w">Gen. iii. 20.</span> This name set forth a great good, before it became associated with the bitter fruit of a great evil. And here we have the Second Adam bowing His Head, and the deep sleep of death falling upon Him upon the Cross, and He sleepeth, that the Lord God may take a thing out of His side, and may make thereof a wife for Him. O what a death was His, which quickeneth the dead! What is cleaner than His Blood? What more health-giving than His wounding?<br />

Then were being held bondsmen to the devil, slaves to evil spirits. But they have been redeemed from that bondage. They had been able to sell themselves, but they were not able to redeem themselves. A Redeemer came and paid the price for them. He shed His Blood, and at that cost bought the world. Ye ask what He bought Look what He paid, and ye shall see what He bought. Christ's Blood was the price. What is His Blood worth? What, but the whole world What but all men They are very unthankful for His redemption, or very proud, who say that It is only precious enough to buy the Africans, or that they themselves are so precious that It was shed only for them.

That Blood was his own, and thereby he redeemed us. Yea, it was to this end that he took Flesh and Blood, namely that he might shed his Blood in order to redeem us. If thou wilt accept it, the Blood of thy Lord was given for thee. If thou wilt not accept it, it was not given for thee. For perchance thou sayest: My God had Blood, with which he redeemed me, but now since he hath suffered, he hath given it all; what hath remained to him, that he may also give any of it for me? This is a great thing, because he gave once, and he gave for all. The Blood of Christ is salvation to him that doth accept it, punishment to him that doth not accept it. Why therefore dost thou hesitate to be set free from the second death, thou who dost not wish to die? By this thou art set free, if thou art willing to take up thy Cross, and follow the Lord; for he took up his Cross and sought his servant.<br />
