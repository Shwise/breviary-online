<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Heb 9:11-12</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>rethren, Christ being come an High Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His Own Blood, He entered in once into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">W</i>ith glad and joyous strains now let each street resound,<br />
And let the laurel wreath each Christian brow entwine;<br />
With torches waving bright, let old and young go forth,<br />
And swell the train in solemn line.<br />
 <br />
Whilst we with bitter tears, with sighs and grief profound,<br />
Wail o'er the saving blood, poured forth upon the tree,<br />
Oh, deeply let us muse, and count the heavy price,<br />
Which Christ hath paid to make us free.<br />
 <br />
The primal man of old, who fell by serpent's guile,<br />
Brought death and many woes upon his fallen race;<br />
But our new Adam, Christ, new life unto us gave,<br />
And brought to all ne'er-ending grace.<br />
 <br />
To heaven's highest height, the wailing cry went up<br />
Of him, who hung in pain, God's own eternal Son;<br />
His saving, priceless blood, his Father's wrath appeased,<br />
And for his sons full pardon won.<br />
 <br />
Whoe'er in that pure blood his guilty soul shall wash,<br />
Shall from his stains be freed—be made as roses bright—<br />
Shall vie with angels pure, shall please his King and Lord,<br />
And precious shine in his glad sight.<br />
 <br />
Oh, from the path of right ne'er let thy steps depart,<br />
But haste thee to the goal in virtue's peaceful ways;<br />
thy God who reigns on high will e'er direct thy steps,<br />
And crown thy deeds with blissful days.<br />
 <br />
Father of all things made, to us propitious be,<br />
For whom thy own dear Son, his saving blood did spill;<br />
O Holy Spirit, grant the souls by thee refreshed<br />
Eternal bliss may ever fill.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> We therefore pray thee, help thy servants.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood.<br />

<span class="w">1:53</span> He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
<span class="w">1:54</span> He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy:<br />
<span class="w">1:55</span> As he spoke to our fathers, * to Abraham and to his seed for ever.<br />
