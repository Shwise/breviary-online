<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 21(2-12)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">21:2</span>  O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? * Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.<br />
<span class="w">21:3</span>  O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: * and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.<br />
<span class="w">21:4</span>  But thou dwellest in the holy place, * the praise of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">21:5</span>  In thee have our fathers hoped: * they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them.<br />
<span class="w">21:6</span>  They cried to thee, and they were saved: * they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<br />
<span class="w">21:7</span>  But I am a worm, and no man: * the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.<br />
<span class="w">21:8</span>  All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: * they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head.<br />
<span class="w">21:9</span>  He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: * let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him.<br />
<span class="w">21:10</span>  For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: * my hope from the breasts of my mother. I was cast upon thee from the womb.<br />
<span class="w">21:11</span>  From my mother’s womb thou art my God, * depart not from me.<br />
<span class="w">21:12</span>  For tribulation is very near: * for there is none to help me.<br />

<span class="w">21:15</span>  I am poured out like water; * and all my bones are scattered.<br />
<span class="w">21:15</span>  My heart is become like wax melting * in the midst of my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">21:16</span>  My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my jaws: * and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death.<br />
<span class="w">21:17</span>  For many dogs have encompassed me: * the council of the malignant hath besieged me.<br />
<span class="w">21:17</span>  They have dug my hands and feet. * They have numbered all my bones.<br />
<span class="w">21:18</span>  And they have looked and stared upon me. * They parted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.<br />
<span class="w">21:20</span>  But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; * look towards my defence.<br />

<span class="w">21:24</span>  Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: * all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him.<br />
<span class="w">21:25</span>  Let all the seed of Israel fear him: * because he hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man.<br />
<span class="w">21:25</span>  Neither hath he turned away his face from me: * and when I cried to him he heard me.<br />
<span class="w">21:26</span>  With thee is my praise in a great church: * I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">21:27</span>  The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: * their hearts shall live for ever and ever.<br />
<span class="w">21:28</span>  All the ends of the earth * shall remember, and shall be converted to the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">21:28</span>  And all the kindreds of the Gentiles * shall adore in his sight.<br />
<span class="w">21:29</span>  For the kingdom is the Lord’s; * and he shall have dominion over the nations.<br />
<span class="w">21:30</span>  All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: * all they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.<br />
<span class="w">21:31</span>  And to him my soul shall live: * and my seed shall serve him.<br />
<span class="w">21:32</span>  There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: * and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made.<br />

<b>Martyrologium </b><em>(anticip.)</em><br />
 <br />
<i class="a">O</i>n the morrow is the Octave of the holy Apostles Peter and Paul. <br />
<b>J</b>uly 6th 2019, the 4th day of the Moon, were born into the better life: <br />
 <br />
<b>I</b>n Judea, the holy Prophet Isaiah, who was sawn asunder under King Manasseh, [about 715 B.C.,] and was buried under the oak at En Rogel beside the flowing of the waters, [the first of the four Greater Prophets.] <br />
<b>A</b>t Rome, the holy martyr Tranquillinus, father of the holy martyrs Mark and Marcellian. He had been converted to Christ by the preaching of the holy martyr Sebastian, baptized by the blessed Priest, Polycarp, and himself ordained a Priest by the holy Pope Caius. He was praying at the grave of blessed Paul, upon the Octave Day of the Apostles, when the pagans under the Emperor Diocletian tried and stoned him. And so he finished his testimony, [in the year 286.] <br />
<b>A</b>t Fiesole, in Tuscany, the holy martyr Romulus, Bishop [of that see,] a disciple of Peter. He was sent forth by the Apostle to preach the gospel, and when he had proclaimed Christ in many places of Italy, he came back to Fiesole, where he and many Companions were crowned with martyrdom under the Emperor Domitian. <br />
<b>I</b>n Campania, the holy Virgin and martyr Dominica, [fourth century.] Under the Emperor Diocletian she was condemned to the beasts for breaking idols, but the beasts did not hurt her. She was then beheaded, and so passed away to be ever with the Lord. Her body is kept with great reverence at Tropea, in Calabria. <br />
<b>O</b>n the same day, the holy martyr Lucy, a Campanian by race, who, being tried and sharply tormented under the Vicar Rixius Varus, turned him to Christ, with whom were joined Antoninus, Severinus, Diodorus, Dion, and seventeen others, who all suffered and were crowned together. <br />
