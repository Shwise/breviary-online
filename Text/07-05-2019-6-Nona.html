<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> strength and stay upholding all creation,<br />
Who ever dost thyself unmoved abide,<br />
Yet day by day the light in due gradation<br />
From hour to hour through all its changes guide:<br />
 <br />
Grant to life’s day a calm unclouded ending,<br />
An eve untouched by shadows of decay,<br />
The brightness of a holy death-bed blending<br />
With dawning glories of th’ eternal day.<br />
 <br />
* Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,<br />
And thou, O Christ, the co-eternal Word,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living<br />
Now and to endless ages art adored.<br />
Amen.<br />
<b>Psalms</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Mercy and truth * shall go before thy face, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 88(2-19)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">88:2</span>  The mercies of the Lord * I will sing for ever.<br />
<span class="w">88:2</span>  I will shew forth thy truth with my mouth * to generation and generation.<br />
<span class="w">88:3</span>  For thou hast said: Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens: * thy truth shall be prepared in them.<br />
<span class="w">88:4</span>  I have made a covenant with my elect: I have sworn to David my servant: * Thy seed will I settle for ever.<br />
<span class="w">88:5</span>  And I will build up thy throne * unto generation and generation.<br />
<span class="w">88:6</span>  The heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Lord: * and thy truth in the church of the saints.<br />
<span class="w">88:7</span>  For who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord: * or who among the sons of God shall be like to God?<br />
<span class="w">88:8</span>  God, who is glorified in the assembly of the saints: * great and terrible above all them that are about him.<br />
<span class="w">88:9</span>  O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? * thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is round about thee.<br />
<span class="w">88:10</span>  Thou rulest the power of the sea: * and appeasest the motion of the waves thereof.<br />
<span class="w">88:11</span>  Thou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain: * with the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.<br />
<span class="w">88:12</span>  Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth: the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded: * the north and the sea thou hast created.<br />
<span class="w">88:13</span>  Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name: * thy arm is with might.<br />
<span class="w">88:14</span>  Let thy hand be strengthened, and thy right hand exalted: * justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne.<br />
<span class="w">88:15</span>  Mercy and truth shall go before thy face: * blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation.<br />
<span class="w">88:16</span>  They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance: and in thy name they shall rejoice all the day, * and in thy justice they shall be exalted.<br />
<span class="w">88:18</span>  For thou art the glory of their strength: * and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be exalted.<br />
<span class="w">88:19</span>  For our protection is of the Lord, * and of our king the holy one of Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 88(20-38)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">88:20</span>  Then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints, and saidst: * I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my people.<br />
<span class="w">88:21</span>  I have found David my servant: * with my holy oil I have anointed him.<br />
<span class="w">88:22</span>  For my hand shall help him: * and my arm shall strengthen him.<br />
<span class="w">88:23</span>  The enemy shall have no advantage over him: * nor the son of iniquity have power to hurt him.<br />
<span class="w">88:24</span>  And I will cut down his enemies before his face; * and them that hate him I will put to flight.<br />
<span class="w">88:25</span>  And my truth and my mercy shall be with him: * and in my name shall his horn be exalted.<br />
<span class="w">88:26</span>  And I will set his hand in the sea; * and his right hand in the rivers.<br />
<span class="w">88:27</span>  He shall cry out to me: Thou art my father: * my God, and the support of my salvation.<br />
<span class="w">88:28</span>  And I will make him my firstborn, * high above the kings of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">88:29</span>  I will keep my mercy for him for ever: * and my covenant faithful to him.<br />
<span class="w">88:30</span>  And I will make his seed to endure for evermore: * and his throne as the days of heaven.<br />
<span class="w">88:31</span>  And if his children forsake my law, * and walk not in my judgments:<br />
<span class="w">88:32</span>  If they profane my justices: * and keep not my commandments:<br />
<span class="w">88:33</span>  I will visit their iniquities with a rod: *and their sins with stripes.<br />
<span class="w">88:34</span>  But my mercy I will not take away from him: * nor will I suffer my truth to fail.<br />
<span class="w">88:35</span>  Neither will I profane my covenant: * and the words that proceed from my mouth I will not make void.<br />
<span class="w">88:36</span>  Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David: * his seed shall endure for ever.<br />
<span class="w">88:37</span>  And his throne as the sun before me: * and as the moon perfect for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 88(39-53)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">88:39</span>  But thou hast rejected and despised: * thou hast been angry with thy anointed.<br />
<span class="w">88:40</span>  Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant: * thou hast profaned his sanctuary on the earth.<br />
<span class="w">88:41</span>  Thou hast broken down all his hedges: * thou hast made his strength fear.<br />
<span class="w">88:42</span>  All that pass by the way have robbed him: * he is become a reproach to his neighbours.<br />
<span class="w">88:43</span>  Thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him: * thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">88:44</span>  Thou hast turned away the help of his sword; * and hast not assisted him in battle.<br />
<span class="w">88:45</span>  Thou hast made his purification to cease: * and thou hast cast his throne down to the ground.<br />
<span class="w">88:46</span>  Thou hast shortened the days of his time: * thou hast covered him with confusion.<br />
<span class="w">88:47</span>  How long, O Lord, turnest thou away unto the end? * shall thy anger burn like fire?<br />
<span class="w">88:48</span>  Remember what my substance is: * for hast thou made all the children of men in vain?<br />
<span class="w">88:49</span>  Who is the man that shall live, and not see death: * that shall deliver his soul from the hand of hell?<br />
<span class="w">88:50</span>  Lord, where are thy ancient mercies, * according to what thou didst swear to David in thy truth?<br />
<span class="w">88:51</span>  Be mindful, O Lord, of the reproach of thy servants * which I have held in my bosom of many nations:<br />
<span class="w">88:52</span>  Wherewith thy enemies have reproached, O Lord; * wherewith they have reproached the change of thy anointed.<br />
<span class="w">88:53</span>  Blessed be the Lord for evermore. * So be it. So be it.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Mercy and truth shall go before thy face, O Lord.<br />
