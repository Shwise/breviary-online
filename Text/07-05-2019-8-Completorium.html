<i class="a">B</i>rothers: Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour. Whom resist ye, strong in faith:<br />

<b>Psalms</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> I have cried * to the Lord with my voice, do not forget to show mercy, O God.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 76(2-13)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">76:2</span>  I cried to the Lord with my voice; * to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.<br />
<span class="w">76:3</span>  In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, * and I was not deceived.<br />
<span class="w">76:4</span>  My soul refused to be comforted: * I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.<br />
<span class="w">76:5</span>  My eyes prevented the watches: * I was troubled, and I spoke not.<br />
<span class="w">76:6</span>  I thought upon the days of old: * and I had in my mind the eternal years.<br />
<span class="w">76:7</span>  And I meditated in the night with my own heart: * and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.<br />
<span class="w">76:8</span>  Will God then cast off for ever? * or will he never be more favourable again?<br />
<span class="w">76:9</span>  Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, * from generation to generation?<br />
<span class="w">76:10</span>  Or will God forget to shew mercy? * or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?<br />
<span class="w">76:11</span>  And I said, Now have I begun: * this is the change of the right hand of the most High.<br />
<span class="w">76:12</span>  I remembered the works of the Lord: * for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning.<br />
<span class="w">76:13</span>  And I will meditate on all thy works: * and will be employed in thy inventions.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 76(14-21)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">76:14</span>  Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God? * Thou art the God that dost wonders.<br />
<span class="w">76:15</span>  Thou hast made thy power known among the nations: * with thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob and of Joseph.<br />
<span class="w">76:17</span>  The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: * and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled.<br />
<span class="w">76:18</span>  Great was the noise of the waters: * the clouds sent out a sound.<br />
<span class="w">76:18</span>  For thy arrows pass: * the voice of thy thunder in a wheel.<br />
<span class="w">76:19</span>  Thy lightnings enlightened the world: * the earth shook and trembled.<br />
<span class="w">76:20</span>  Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: * and thy footsteps shall not be known.<br />
<span class="w">76:21</span>  Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, * by the hand of Moses and Aaron.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 85</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">85:1</span>  Incline thy ear, O Lord, and hear me: * for I am needy and poor.<br />
<span class="w">85:2</span>  Preserve my soul, for I am holy: * save thy servant, O my God, that trusteth in thee.<br />
<span class="w">85:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I have cried to thee all the day. * Give joy to the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, I have lifted up my soul.<br />
<span class="w">85:5</span>  For thou, O Lord, art sweet and mild: * and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee.<br />
<span class="w">85:6</span>  Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer: * and attend to the voice of my petition.<br />
<span class="w">85:7</span>  I have called upon thee in the day of my trouble: * because thou hast heard me.<br />
<span class="w">85:8</span>  There is none among the gods like unto thee, O Lord: * and there is none according to thy works.<br />
<span class="w">85:9</span>  All the nations thou hast made shall come and adore before thee, O Lord: * and they shall glorify thy name.<br />
<span class="w">85:10</span>  For thou art great and dost wonderful things: * thou art God alone.<br />
<span class="w">85:11</span>  Conduct me, O Lord, in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth: * let my heart rejoice that it may fear thy name.<br />
<span class="w">85:12</span>  I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, * and I will glorify thy name for ever:<br />
<span class="w">85:13</span>  For thy mercy is great towards me: * and thou hast delivered my soul out of the lower hell.<br />
<span class="w">85:14</span>  O God, the wicked are risen up against me, and the assembly of the mighty have sought my soul: * and they have not set thee before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">85:15</span>  And thou, O Lord, art a God of compassion, and merciful, * patient, and of much mercy, and true.<br />
<span class="w">85:16</span>  O look upon me, and have mercy on me: * give thy command to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.<br />
<span class="w">85:17</span>  Shew me a token for good: that they who hate me may see, and be confounded, * because thou, O Lord, hast helped me and hast comforted me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> I have cried to the Lord with my voice, do not forget to show mercy, O God.<br />

<br />
<i class="a">B</i>efore the ending of the day,<br />
Creator of the world, we pray<br />

From all ill dreams defend our eyes,<br />
From nightly fears and fantasies;<br />
Tread under foot our ghostly foe,<br />

Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
