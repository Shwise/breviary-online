<span class="w">97:1</span>  Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: * because he hath done wonderful things.<br />
<span class="w">97:1</span>  His right hand hath wrought for him salvation, * and his arm is holy.<br />
<span class="w">97:2</span>  The Lord hath made known his salvation: * he hath revealed his justice in the sight of the Gentiles.<br />
<span class="w">97:3</span>  He hath remembered his mercy * and his truth toward the house of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">97:3</span>  All the ends of the earth have seen * the salvation of our God.<br />
<span class="w">97:4</span>  Sing joyfully to God, all the earth; * make melody, rejoice and sing.<br />
<span class="w">97:5</span>  Sing praise to the Lord on the harp, on the harp, and with the voice of a psalm: * with long trumpets, and sound of cornet.<br />
<span class="w">97:6</span>  Make a joyful noise before the Lord our king: * let the sea be moved and the fulness thereof: the world and they that dwell therein.<br />
<span class="w">97:8</span>  The rivers shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice together at the presence of the Lord: * because he cometh to judge the earth.<br />
<span class="w">97:9</span>  He shall judge the world with justice, * and the people with equity.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 89</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">89:1</span>  Lord, thou hast been our refuge * <span class="w">‡</span> from generation to generation.<br />
<span class="w">89:2</span>  Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; * from eternity and to eternity thou art God.<br />
<span class="w">89:3</span>  Turn not man away to be brought low: * and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men.<br />
<span class="w">89:4</span>  For a thousand years in thy sight * are as yesterday, which is past.<br />
<span class="w">89:5</span>  And as a watch in the night, * things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.<br />
<span class="w">89:6</span>  In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: * in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither.<br />
<span class="w">89:7</span>  For in thy wrath we have fainted away: * and are troubled in thy indignation.<br />
<span class="w">89:8</span>  Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: * our life in the light of thy countenance.<br />
<span class="w">89:9</span>  For all our days are spent; * and in thy wrath we have fainted away.<br />
<span class="w">89:9</span>  Our years shall be considered as a spider: * the days of our years in them are threescore and ten years.<br />
<span class="w">89:10</span>  But if in the strong they be fourscore years: * and what is more of them is labour and sorrow.<br />
<span class="w">89:10</span>  For mildness is come upon us: * and we shall be corrected.<br />

<span class="w">89:14</span>  We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: * and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.<br />
<span class="w">89:15</span>  We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: * for the years in which we have seen evils.<br />
<span class="w">89:16</span>  Look upon thy servants and upon their works: * and direct their children.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 35</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">35:2</span>  The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin: * there is no fear of God before his eyes.<br />
<span class="w">35:3</span>  For in his sight he hath done deceitfully, * that his iniquity may be found unto hatred.<br />
<span class="w">35:4</span>  The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile: * he would not understand that he might do well.<br />
<span class="w">35:5</span>  He hath devised iniquity on his bed, * he hath set himself on every way that is not good: but evil he hath not hated.<br />
<span class="w">35:6</span>  O Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, * and thy truth reacheth even to the clouds.<br />
<span class="w">35:7</span>  Thy justice is as the mountains of God, * thy judgments are a great deep.<br />
<span class="w">35:7</span>  Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord: * O how hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God!<br />
<span class="w">35:8</span>  But the children of men * shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings.<br />
<span class="w">35:9</span>  They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house; * and thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure.<br />
<span class="w">35:10</span>  For with thee is the fountain of life; * and in thy light we shall see light.<br />
<span class="w">35:11</span>  Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, * and thy justice to them that are right in heart.<br />
<span class="w">35:12</span>  Let not the foot of pride come to me, * and let not the hand of the sinner move me.<br />
<span class="w">35:13</span>  There the workers of iniquity are fallen, * they are cast out, and could not stand.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">31:11</span>  And say: He that scattered Israel will gather him: * and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his flock.<br />

<span class="w">31:15</span>  And their soul shall be as a watered garden, * and they shall be hungry no more.<br />
<span class="w">31:16</span>  Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, * the young men and old men together:<br />
<span class="w">31:17</span>  And I will turn their mourning into joy, * and will comfort them, and make them joyful after their sorrow.<br />
<span class="w">31:18</span>  And I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness: * and my people shall be filled with my good things.<br />

<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Rom. 13:12-13</span><br />
<i class="a">T</i>he night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">S</i>ee the golden sun arise!<br />
Let no more our darkened eyes<br />
Snare us, tangled by surprise <br />
In the maze of sin!<br />
 <br />
From false words and thoughts impure<br />
Let this light, serene and sure, <br />
Keep our lips without secure,<br />
Keep our souls within.<br />
 <br />
So may we the day-time spend, <br />
That, till life’s temptations end, <br />
Tongue, nor hand, nor eye offend!<br />
One, above us all,<br />
 <br />
Views in his revealing ray <br />
All we do, and think, and say, <br />
Watching us from break of day<br />
Till the twilight fall.<br />
 <br />
Unto God the Father, Son, <br />
Holy Spirit, Three in One, <br />
One in Three, be glory done,<br />
Now and evermore.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> We are filled in the morning with thy mercy.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And we have rejoiced, and are delighted.<br />
