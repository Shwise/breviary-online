<span class="w">46:2</span>  O clap your hands, all ye nations: * shout unto God with the voice of joy,<br />
<span class="w">46:3</span>  For the Lord is high, terrible: * a great king over all the earth.<br />
<span class="w">46:4</span>  He hath subdued the people under us; * and the nations under our feet.<br />

<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">S</i>on of the Highest, deign to cast<br />
On us a pitying eye;<br />
Thou, who repentant Magdalene<br />
Didst call to endless joy.<br />
 <br />
Again the royal treasury<br />
Receives its long-lost coin;<br />
The gem is found, and, cleansed from mire,<br />
Doth all the stars outshine.<br />
 <br />
O Jesus, balm of every wound!<br />
The sinner's only stay!<br />
Wash thou in Magdalene's pure tears<br />
Our guilty spots away.<br />
 <br />
Mother of God! the sons of Eve<br />
Weeping thine aid implore:<br />
Oh, land us from the storms of life<br />
Safe on th' eternal shore.<br />
 <br />
Glory, for graces manifold,<br />
To the one only Lord;<br />
Whose mercy doth our souls forgive,<br />
Whose bounty doth reward.<br />
