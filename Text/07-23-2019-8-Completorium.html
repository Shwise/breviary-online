<span class="w">11:4</span>  May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, * and the tongue that speaketh proud things.<br />
<span class="w">11:5</span>  Who have said: We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own; * who is Lord over us?<br />
<span class="w">11:6</span>  By reason of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor, * now will I arise, saith the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">11:6</span>  I will set him in safety; * I will deal confidently in his regard.<br />

<span class="w">15:6</span>  The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places: * for my inheritance is goodly to me.<br />
<span class="w">15:7</span>  I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding: * moreover my reins also have corrected me even till night.<br />
<span class="w">15:8</span>  I set the Lord always in my sight: * for he is at my right hand, that I be not moved.<br />
<span class="w">15:9</span>  Therefore my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced: * moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.<br />
<span class="w">15:10</span>  Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; * nor wilt thou give thy holy one to see corruption.<br />

Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
