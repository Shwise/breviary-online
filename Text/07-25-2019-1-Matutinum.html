<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>h' eternal gifts of Christ the King,<br />
The Apostles' glory, let us sing;<br />
And all with hearts of gladness raise<br />
Due hymns of thankful love and praise.<br />
 <br />
For they the Church's princes are,<br />
Triumphant leaders in the war,<br />
The heavenly King's own warrior band,<br />
True lights to lighten every land.<br />
 <br />
Theirs was the steadfast faith of saints,<br />
The hope that never yields nor faints,<br />
The love of Christ in perfect glow,<br />
That lay the prince of this world low.<br />
 <br />
In them the Father's glory shone,<br />
In them the Spirit's will was done,<br />
The Son himself exults in them;<br />
Joy fills the new Jerusalem.<br />
 <br />
* Praise to the Father, with the Son,<br />
And Holy Spirit, Three in One;<br />
As ever was in ages past,<br />
And so shall be while ages last.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">18:6</span>  He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: * and he, as a bridegroom coming out of his bride chamber,<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,<br />
<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">18:9</span>  The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">18:10</span>  The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.<br />
<span class="w">18:11</span>  More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br />
<span class="w">18:12</span>  For thy servant keepeth them, * and in keeping them there is a great reward.<br />
<span class="w">18:13</span>  Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: * and from those of others spare thy servant.<br />

<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />

<span class="w">33:11</span>  The rich have wanted, and have suffered hunger: * but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good.<br />
<span class="w">33:12</span>  Come, children, hearken to me: * I will teach you the fear of the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">33:13</span>  Who is the man that desireth life: * who loveth to see good days?<br />

Lesson from the first letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians<br />
<span class="ri">1 Cor 4:1-5</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> Here now it is required among the dispensers, that a man be found faithful.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you, or by man's day; but neither do I judge my own self.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> For I am not conscious to myself of any thing, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Therefore judge not before the time; until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise from God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves, said the Lord:<br />
* Be ye, therefore, wise as serpents and simple as doves.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Be ye therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />

<span class="ri">1 Cor 4:6-9</span><br />
<span class="w">6</span> But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes; that in us you may learn, that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> For who distinguisheth thee? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received? And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?<br />
<span class="w">8</span> You are now full; you are now become rich; you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death: we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />

James, the Son of Zebedee and brother of the Apostle John, was a Galilean, and with his brother one of the first of His Apostles whom the Lord called, whileas they were in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets and they immediately left the ship, and their father, and followed Him. <span class="w">Matth. iv. 21, 22.</span> And He surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder. <span class="w">Mark iii. 17.</span> Peter, and James, and John, were the three Apostles whom the Saviour loved best; them He took and brought up into an high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them, <span class="w">Matth. xvii. 1,2;</span> when He went to the house of the ruler of the synagogue to raise his daughter from the dead, He suffered no man to follow Him save Peter, and James, and John, <span class="w">Mark v. 37;</span> and, at the last, just before the Jews took Him, when He cometh unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples: Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee. <span class="w">Matth. xxvi. 36, 37.</span><br />

After that Jesus Christ was ascended into heaven, James preached how that He was God, and led many in Judaea and Samaria to the Christian Faith. A while afterward, he went to Spain, and there he brought some to Christ, of whom seven were afterwards ordained Bishops by Blessed Peter, and were the first such sent into that country. From Spain James went back to Jerusalem, where he taught the Faith to divers persons, and, among others, to the Magian Hermogenes. Thereupon Herod Agrippa, who had been raised to the kingdom under the Emperor Claudius, to curry favour with the Jews, condemned James to death for his firm confession that Jesus Christ is God. The officer who led James to the judgment-seat, at sight of the courage wherewith he was ready to offer up his testimony, declared himself also to be a Christian.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake;<br />

As they were being hurried to execution, this man asked pardon of James, and the Apostle kissed him, saying, Peace be unto thee. James healed a paralytic, and immediately afterwards both the prisoners were beheaded. The body of the Apostle was afterwards taken to Compostella, (in the province of Galicia, in Spain,) where his grave is very famous. Multitudes of pilgrims from all parts of the earth betake themselves thither to pray, out of sheer piety or in fulfilment of vows. The Birthday of James is kept by the Church upon this day, which is that of the bringing of his body to Compostella. It was about Easter-time <span class="w">Acts xii. 2-4</span> that he bore witness to Jesus Christ with his blood, at Jerusalem, being the first of the Apostles to do so.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 20:20-23</span><br />
At that time, came to Jesus the mother of Zebedee's children, with her sons, worshipping Him, and desiring a certain thing of Him. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. John Chrysostom<br />
<span class="ri">66th on Matth.</span><br />
Let no man be troubled if we say that the Apostles were still imperfect, for the mystery of the Cross was not yet finished, the grace of the Spirit had not yet been shed abroad in their hearts. If thou wilt behold them in their strength, consider them such as they became after the grace of the Spirit was given them, and thou wilt perceive that they had trodden under foot every vain desire. This is the cause wherefore their present imperfection is made known unto us, that is, that thou mayest see how great a change could be forthwith wrought by grace. But nevertheless let us now look how they came unto Christ, and what they said. Master, they said, we would that Thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire. <span class="w">Mark x. 35.</span> And He said unto them: What would ye that I should do for you? <span class="w">Mark X. 36.</span> not, surely, that He knew not what their wish was, but that He would make them answer, and so uncover the wound, to lay a plaster upon it.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> These are they who while yet they lived in the flesh, planted the Church in their own blood;<br />

Their wish proceeded from earthly motives, and they were shy and ashamed to express it, and therefore they took Christ apart, and so asked Him. The Evangelist saith: For they were gone apart, that they might not be discovered of them and then they told Him what they sought. To me it seemeth most likely that they had heard how that the disciples should sit upon twelve thrones; they were fain to obtain for themselves the chiefest places at this enthronement; they knew that the Lord loved them better than the most of the others; but they feared that Peter would still be preferred before them; and therefore they made bold to say: Grant unto us that we may sit, one at thy right Hand, and the other at thy left Hand, in thy glory. <span class="w">Mark x. 37.</span> They were even instant with Him, saying: Say that we may. And what answered He? To show that they were asking no spiritual gift, nor even knew for themselves what they were asking, nor would have asked it if they had known what it was, Jesus said unto them: Ye know not what ye ask, ye know not how great a thing, how wonderful a thing this is, a thing which even is not Mine to give.<br />

And He said moreover: Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? Behold how He turneth their thoughts at once another way, speaking to them of things altogether different, as though He said, Ye come unto Me treating of honours and crowns, but I speak unto you of the wrestling and the sweat. This is not yet the time of reward, neither is My glory immediately to be revealed; but now death and danger are present with you. But consider how, by the manner of His questioning, He doth both exhort and invite them. He saith not Are ye able to bear death? Are ye able to shed your blood? but: How are ye able to drink the cup whereto He presently inviteth them, saying: the cup that I shall drink of; that He may make them readier for the strife by knowing that it is a strife which they are to share with Him.<br />
