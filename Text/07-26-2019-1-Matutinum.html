<span class="w">16</span> She hath considered a field, and bought it: with the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.<br />

From the Sermons of St. John of Damascus<br />
<span class="ri">2nd on the Birth of the Blessed Virgin</span><br />
The home of Anne is set before us, wherein to see an example both of married and of maiden life, the one in the person of the mother, the other in that of the daughter, whereof the one hath but now ceased to be barren, and the other is in a little while destined, beyond the course of nature, to become the Mother of the Messiah by a singular birth, specially designed by God to build up anew our nature. It is with reason then that Anne, filled with the Holy Ghost, with joyful and jubilant spirit singeth aloud: Rejoice with me, for out of my barren womb I have borne the bud of promise, and, as I have longed, I nourish at my breasts the fruit of benediction. I have laid aside the mournful garments of barrenness, and put on the joyful raiment of fruitfulness. Let Hannah the adversary of Peninnah make merry with me, and join with me for fellow-feeling, in singing of this new and unhoped-for wonder that is wrought in me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

Let Sarah be glad that was joyfully pregnant in her old age, and was a shadow cast before of my conception that hitherto have been barren. Let all the barren and fruitless break forth into singing, when they behold in what wondrous wise I have been visited from heaven. Let all mothers likewise, that like Anne are gifted with fruitfulness, say: Blessed be He That gave their desire unto them that besought Him, That gave fruitfulness unto her that was barren, and That granted unto her that from her should bud forth the joy-bringing Virgin, who, according to the flesh, was Mother of God, and whose womb was a heaven wherein He dwelt Whom no place can contain. Let us also with them offer our praises to her that was called barren, but now is become the mother of a maidchild; let us say unto her in the words of the Scripture: O how blessed is the house of David from whence thou art sprung, and that womb wherein God hath fashioned the ark of His holiness, that is, her, by whom He was Himself conceived without man's seed.<br />

Blessed art thou, and thrice blessed, whom God hath so blessed as to make thee to bring forth, as His own gift, the babe Mary, whose very name is highly honourable, out of whom Christ, the Flower of life, blossomed a maiden whose rising is glorious, and whose delivery is worth more than the world. We also, O woman most blessed, do wish thee joy. In sooth thou hast brought forth what we have all hoped for, and God hath given us, namely, the babe of promise. Blessed indeed art thou, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. The tongues of all the godly do magnify thine offspring, and every glad word is spoken concerning her of whom thou art delivered. Meet in truth is it, and most meet to praise her who received a revelation from the goodness of God, and bore for us such and so great a fruit, from whom sweet Jesus sprang.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 13:44</span><br />
At that time Jesus spake unto His disciples this parable The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great<br />
<span class="ri">11th on the Gospels</span><br />
Dearly beloved brethren, the kingdom of heaven is likened unto the things of earth, to the end that by the mean of things which we know, our mind may rise to the contemplation of the things which we know not by the example of things which are seen, may fix her gaze on things which are not seen by the touch of things which she useth, may be warmed towards the things which she useth not; by things which she knoweth and loveth, to love also the things which she knoweth not. For, behold, "the kingdom of heaven is likened unto treasure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and, for joy thereof, goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field."<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to the ways of her household<br />
* And eateth not the bread of idleness.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> She tasteth and perceiveth that her merchandise is good. Her candle goeth not out by night.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And she eateth not the bread of idleness.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>She whose feast-day we are keeping, be our Advocate with God. Amen <br />
 <br />
<b>Reading 8</b><br />
And herein we must remark that the treasure, when once it hath been found, is hidden to keep it safe. He who keepeth not hidden from the praises of men his eager striving heavenwards, doth not enough to keep the same safe from the attacks of evil spirits. In this life we are, as it were, on the way home, and the road is beset by evil spirits, as it were, by highwaymen. He, therefore, inviteth robbery who carrieth his treasure glaringly. This I say, not that our neighbour should not see our good works since it is written: "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father by what we do, to gain the praise of men. Let the outward work agree with the inward thought, that by our good works we may give an example to our neighbour, and still, by our intention, directed only to the pleasing God, we may also have liefer that our works were secret.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The kingdom of this world and all the beauty of life I have esteemed as nothing, for the excellency of the love of Jesus Christ my Lord<br />

<b>Reading 9</b><br />
The treasure is the desire for heaven, the field wherein it is hidden is the earnest observance wherewith this desire is surrounded. Whosoever turneth his back upon the enjoyments of the flesh, and by earnest striving heavenward, putteth all earthly lusts under the feet of discipline, so that he smileth back no more when the flesh smileth at him, and shuddereth no more at anything that can only kill the body whosoever doth thus, hath sold all that he had, and bought that field.<br />
