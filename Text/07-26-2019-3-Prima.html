<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 21(2-12)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">21:2</span>  O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? * Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.<br />
<span class="w">21:3</span>  O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: * and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.<br />
<span class="w">21:4</span>  But thou dwellest in the holy place, * the praise of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">21:5</span>  In thee have our fathers hoped: * they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them.<br />
<span class="w">21:6</span>  They cried to thee, and they were saved: * they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<br />
<span class="w">21:7</span>  But I am a worm, and no man: * the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.<br />
<span class="w">21:8</span>  All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: * they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head.<br />
<span class="w">21:9</span>  He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: * let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him.<br />
<span class="w">21:10</span>  For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: * my hope from the breasts of my mother. I was cast upon thee from the womb.<br />
<span class="w">21:11</span>  From my mother’s womb thou art my God, * depart not from me.<br />
<span class="w">21:12</span>  For tribulation is very near: * for there is none to help me.<br />

<span class="w">21:15</span>  I am poured out like water; * and all my bones are scattered.<br />
<span class="w">21:15</span>  My heart is become like wax melting * in the midst of my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">21:16</span>  My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my jaws: * and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death.<br />
<span class="w">21:17</span>  For many dogs have encompassed me: * the council of the malignant hath besieged me.<br />
<span class="w">21:17</span>  They have dug my hands and feet. * They have numbered all my bones.<br />
<span class="w">21:18</span>  And they have looked and stared upon me. * They parted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.<br />
<span class="w">21:20</span>  But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; * look towards my defence.<br />
<span class="w">21:21</span>  Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: * my only one from the hand of the dog.<br />

<span class="w">21:24</span>  Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: * all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him.<br />
<span class="w">21:25</span>  Let all the seed of Israel fear him: * because he hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man.<br />
<span class="w">21:25</span>  Neither hath he turned away his face from me: * and when I cried to him he heard me.<br />
<span class="w">21:26</span>  With thee is my praise in a great church: * I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">21:27</span>  The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: * their hearts shall live for ever and ever.<br />
<span class="w">21:28</span>  All the ends of the earth * shall remember, and shall be converted to the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">21:28</span>  And all the kindreds of the Gentiles * shall adore in his sight.<br />
<span class="w">21:29</span>  For the kingdom is the Lord’s; * and he shall have dominion over the nations.<br />
<span class="w">21:30</span>  All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: * all they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.<br />
<span class="w">21:31</span>  And to him my soul shall live: * and my seed shall serve him.<br />
<span class="w">21:32</span>  There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: * and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made.<br />
