<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow, from the slumbers of the night arising, <br />
Chant we the holy psalmody of David,<br />
Hymns to our Master, with a voice concordant,<br />
Sweetly intoning.<br />
 <br />
So may our Monarch pitifully hear us,<br />
That we may merit with his saints to enter<br />
Mansions eternal, therewithal possessing<br />
Joy beatific.<br />
 <br />
This be our portion, God forever blessed,<br />
Father eternal, Son, and Holy Spirit,<br />
Whose is the glory, which through all creation<br />
Ever resoundeth.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">1:4</span>  Not so the wicked, not so: * but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">1:5</span>  Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: * nor sinners in the council of the just.<br />
<span class="w">1:6</span>  For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: * and the way of the wicked shall perish.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 2</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">2:1</span>  Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?<br />
<span class="w">2:2</span>  The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, * against the Lord and against his Christ.<br />
<span class="w">2:3</span>  Let us break their bonds asunder: * and let us cast away their yoke from us.<br />
<span class="w">2:4</span>  He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: * and the Lord shall deride them.<br />

<span class="w">2:6</span>  But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain, * preaching his commandment.<br />

<span class="w">3:4</span>  But thou, O Lord art my protector, * my glory, and the lifter up of my head.<br />
<span class="w">3:5</span>  I have cried to the Lord with my voice: * and he hath heard me from his holy hill.<br />
<span class="w">3:6</span>  I have slept and taken my rest: * and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.<br />
<span class="w">3:7</span>  I will not fear thousands of the people, surrounding me: * arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.<br />
<span class="w">3:8</span>  For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause: * thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.<br />

<span class="w">8:3</span>  Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise, because of thy enemies, * that thou mayst destroy the enemy and the avenger.<br />
<span class="w">8:4</span>  For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: * the moon and the stars which thou hast founded.<br />
<span class="w">8:5</span>  What is man that thou art mindful of him? * or the son of man that thou visitest him?<br />
<span class="w">8:6</span>  Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour: * and hast set him over the works of thy hands.<br />
<span class="w">8:8</span>  Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, * all sheep and oxen: moreover the beasts also of the fields.<br />

<span class="w">9:7</span>  The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: * and their cities thou hast destroyed.<br />
<span class="w">9:8</span>  Their memory hath perished with a noise. * But the Lord remaineth for ever.<br />

Lesson from the first book of Kings<br />
<span class="ri">1 Kgs 1:1-4</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> Now king David was old, and advanced in years: and when he was covered with clothes, he was not warm.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> His servants therefore said to him: Let us seek for our lord the king, a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish him, and sleep in his bosom, and warm our lord the king.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> So they sought a beautiful young woman in all the coasts of Israel, and they found Abisag a Sunamitess, and brought her to the king.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And the damsel was exceeding beautiful, and she slept with the king: and served him, but the king did not know her.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him Only<br />
* And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Return unto Him with all your hearts, and put away the strange gods from among you.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And He will deliver you out of the hand of your enemies.<br />

<span class="ri">1 Kgs 1:5-8</span><br />
<span class="w">5</span> And Adonias the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying: I will be king. And he made himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> Neither did his father rebuke him at any time, saying: Why hast thou done this? And he also was very beautiful, the next in birth after Absalom.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> And he conferred with Joab the son of Sarvia, and with Abiathar the priest, who furthered Adonias's side.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> But Sadoc the priest, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of David's army was not with Adonias.<br />
<span class="ri">1 Kgs 1:11-15</span><br />
<span class="w">11</span> And Nathan said to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon: Hast thou not heard that Adonias the son of Haggith reigneth, and our lord David knoweth it not?<br />
<span class="w">12</span> Now then come, take my counsel and save thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> Go, and get thee in to king David, and say to him: Didst not thou, my lord O king, swear to me thy handmaid, saying: Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then doth Adonias reign?<br />
<span class="w">14</span> And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come in after thee, and will fill up thy words.<br />
<span class="w">15</span> So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber: now the king was very old, and Abisag the Sunamitess ministered to him.<br />

Homily by St. Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers.<br />
<span class="ri">Comment. on Matth. ch. vi.</span><br />
The Lord here warneth us that we must rate the worth of soft words and seeming meekness, by the fruits which they that manifest such things bring forth in their works, and that we should look, in order to see what a man is, not at his professions, but at his deeds. For there are many in whom sheep's clothing is but a mask to hide wolfish ravening. But "Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit." Thus, the Lord teacheth us, is it with men also evil men bring not forth good fruits, and hereby are we to know them. Lip-service alone winneth not the kingdom of heaven, nor is every one that saith unto Christ: "Lord, Lord," an heir thereof.<br />

Thou sittest at the right hand of God, * in the glory of the Father.<br />
We believe that thou shalt come * to be our Judge.<br />

Govern them, * and lift them up for ever.<br />

O Lord, in thee have I trusted, * let me never be confounded.<br />
