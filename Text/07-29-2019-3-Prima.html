<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">18:14</span>  If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  O Lord, my helper, * and my redeemer.<br />

<b>Martyrologium </b><em>(anticip.)</em><br />
 <br />
<i class="a">O</i>n the morrow we keep the feast of the holy Germain, Bishop of Auxerre, a man illustrious alike for his birth, his faith, his teaching, and the glory of his miracles, who rid Britain of the Pelagian heresy, and of whom mention is made upon the morrow. <br />
<b>J</b>uly 30th 2019, the 28th day of the Moon, were born into the better life:  <br />
 <br />
<b>A</b>t Rome, the holy martyrs Abdon and Sennen. These were Persians who were brought to Rome in bonds under Decius. They were first hided with scourges loaded with lead, and then slain with the sword. <br />
<b>A</b>t Tuburbe, in Africa, the holy Virgin martyrs Maxima, Donatilla, and Secunda. In the persecution under Valerian and Gallienus, Maxima and Donatilla were given vinegar and gall to drink, then severely hided and racked, burnt over gratings, and rubbed with lime. Afterward, they were thrown to the beasts along with Secunda, a virgin of twelve years of age, but as the beasts would not touch them they were all slain with the sword. <br />
<b>A</b>t Assisi, in Umbria, the holy martyr Rufinus. <br />
<b>A</b>t Caesarea, in Cappadocia, [in the time of the Emperor Diocletian,] the holy martyr Julitta. She raised a law plea against a certain great man who had spoiled her goods, and he pleaded against her that being a Christian she could not be heard, whereupon the judge commanded her to offer some incense to the idols in order that she might be able to plead. She firmly refused, and was cast into the fire, where she resigned her soul to God, but the fire did not hurt her body. Her famous praises have been set forth by holy Basil the Great in a noble discourse. <br />
<b>A</b>t Auxerre, [at the beginning of the sixth century,] the holy Confessor Ursus, Bishop [of that See.] <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And elsewhere many other holy martyrs, confessors, and holy virgins.<br />
