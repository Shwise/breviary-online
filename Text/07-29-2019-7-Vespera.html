<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">2 Cor 10:17-18</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>rothers: But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he who commendeth himself, is approved, but he, whom God commendeth.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esu, the virgins' crown, do thou<br />
Accept us as in prayer we bow;<br />
Born of that Virgin, whom alone<br />
The mother and the maid we own.<br />
 <br />
Amongst the lilies thou dost feed,<br />
By virgin choirs accompanied; <br />
With glory decked, the spotless brides<br />
Whose bridal gifts thy love provides.<br />
 <br />
They, wheresoe'er thy footsteps bend,<br />
With hymns and praises still attend:<br />
In blessèd troops they follow thee,<br />
With dance, and song, and melody.<br />
 <br />
We pray thee therefore to bestow<br />
Upon our senses here below<br />
Thy grace, that so we may endure<br />
From taint of all corruption pure.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, eternal Son, to thee;<br />
All glory as is ever meet,<br />
To God, the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen. <br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grace is poured into thy lips.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.<br />
