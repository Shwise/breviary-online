<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> strength and stay upholding all creation,<br />
Who ever dost thyself unmoved abide,<br />
Yet day by day the light in due gradation<br />
From hour to hour through all its changes guide:<br />
 <br />
Grant to life’s day a calm unclouded ending,<br />
An eve untouched by shadows of decay,<br />
The brightness of a holy death-bed blending<br />
With dawning glories of th’ eternal day.<br />
 <br />
* Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,<br />
And thou, O Christ, the co-eternal Word,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living<br />
Now and to endless ages art adored.<br />
Amen.<br />
<b>Psalms</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Thou hast saved us, O Lord, * and in thy name we will give praise for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 43(2-9)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">43:2</span>  We have heard, O God, with our ears: * our fathers have declared to us,<br />
<span class="w">43:2</span>  The work thou hast wrought in their days, * and in the days of old.<br />
<span class="w">43:3</span>  Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them: * thou didst afflict the people and cast them out.<br />
<span class="w">43:4</span>  For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword: * neither did their own arm save them.<br />
<span class="w">43:4</span>  But thy right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance: * because thou wast pleased with them.<br />
<span class="w">43:5</span>  Thou art thyself my king and my God, * who commandest the saving of Jacob.<br />
<span class="w">43:6</span>  Through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn: * and through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us.<br />
<span class="w">43:7</span>  For I will not trust in my bow: * neither shall my sword save me.<br />
<span class="w">43:8</span>  But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us: * and hast put them to shame that hate us.<br />
<span class="w">43:9</span>  In God shall we glory all the day long: * and in thy name we will give praise for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 43(10-20)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">43:10</span>  But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame: * and thou, O God, wilt not go out with our armies.<br />
<span class="w">43:11</span>  Thou hast made us turn our back to our enemies: * and they that hated us plundered for themselves.<br />
<span class="w">43:12</span>  Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten: * thou hast scattered us among the nations.<br />
<span class="w">43:13</span>  Thou hast sold thy people for no price: * and there was no reckoning in the exchange of them.<br />
<span class="w">43:14</span>  Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, * a scoff and derision to them that are round about us.<br />
<span class="w">43:15</span>  Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles: * a shaking of the head among the people.<br />
<span class="w">43:16</span>  All the day long my shame is before me: * and the confusion of my face hath covered me.<br />
<span class="w">43:17</span>  At the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me: * at the face of the enemy and persecutor.<br />
<span class="w">43:18</span>  All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee: * and we have not done wickedly in thy covenant.<br />
<span class="w">43:19</span>  And our heart hath not turned back: * neither hast thou turned aside our steps from thy way.<br />
<span class="w">43:20</span>  For thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction: * and the shadow of death hath covered us.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 43(21-26)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">43:21</span>  If we have forgotten the name of our God, * and if we have spread forth our hands to a strange god:<br />
<span class="w">43:22</span>  Shall not God search out these things: * for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.<br />
<span class="w">43:22</span>  Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long: * we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.<br />
<span class="w">43:23</span>  Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? * arise, and cast us not off to the end.<br />
<span class="w">43:24</span>  Why turnest thou thy face away? * and forgettest our want and our trouble?<br />
<span class="w">43:25</span>  For our soul is humbled down to the dust: * our belly cleaveth to the earth.<br />
<span class="w">43:26</span>  Arise, O Lord, help us * and redeem us for thy name’s sake.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Thou hast saved us, O Lord, and in thy name we will give praise for ever.<br />
