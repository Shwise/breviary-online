<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow, from the slumbers of the night arising, <br />
Chant we the holy psalmody of David,<br />
Hymns to our Master, with a voice concordant,<br />
Sweetly intoning.<br />
 <br />
So may our Monarch pitifully hear us,<br />
That we may merit with his saints to enter<br />
Mansions eternal, therewithal possessing<br />
Joy beatific.<br />
 <br />
This be our portion, God forever blessed,<br />
Father eternal, Son, and Holy Spirit,<br />
Whose is the glory, which through all creation<br />
Ever resoundeth.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 2</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">2:1</span>  Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?<br />

<span class="w">5</span> A wise man shall hear and shall be wiser: and he that understandeth, shall possess governments.<br />

<span class="ri">Prov 1:7-14</span><br />
<span class="w">7</span> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<br />
<span class="w">9</span> That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold to thy neck.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause:<br />
<span class="w">12</span> Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into the pit.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils.<br />

At that time, Jesus spake this parable unto His disciples: There was a certain rich man, which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.<br />
<span class="ri">Letter 151. to Algasia.</span><br />
The lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely though wickedly. The lord, although himself defrauded by it, could not but praise the shrewdness of his dishonest servant, because he had cheated him with profit to himself. How much more will our Master Christ, Who is above any defrauding by us, and is Himself the Great Forgiver, praise us if we win a blessing from Him by dealing indulgently with those who are to believe in Him?<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
