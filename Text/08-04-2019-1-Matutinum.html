<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow, from the slumbers of the night arising, <br />
Chant we the holy psalmody of David,<br />
Hymns to our Master, with a voice concordant,<br />
Sweetly intoning.<br />
 <br />
So may our Monarch pitifully hear us,<br />
That we may merit with his saints to enter<br />
Mansions eternal, therewithal possessing<br />
Joy beatific.<br />
 <br />
This be our portion, God forever blessed,<br />
Father eternal, Son, and Holy Spirit,<br />
Whose is the glory, which through all creation<br />
Ever resoundeth.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">7</span> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<br />

<span class="w">11</span> If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause:<br />
<span class="w">12</span> Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into the pit.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils.<br />

 <br />
Homily by St. Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.<br />
<span class="ri">Letter 151. to Algasia.</span><br />
The lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely though wickedly. The lord, although himself defrauded by it, could not but praise the shrewdness of his dishonest servant, because he had cheated him with profit to himself. How much more will our Master Christ, Who is above any defrauding by us, and is Himself the Great Forgiver, praise us if we win a blessing from Him by dealing indulgently with those who are to believe in Him?<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
 <br />

 <br />
<span class="ri">During the following verse all make a profound bow:</span><br />
When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man, * thou didst not abhor the Virgin's womb.<br />
 <br />
When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, * thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.<br />
Thou sittest at the right hand of God, * in the glory of the Father.<br />
We believe that thou shalt come * to be our Judge.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Kneel for the following verse</span><br />
We therefore pray thee, help thy servants, * whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious Blood.<br />
 <br />
Make them to be numbered with thy Saints, * in glory everlasting.<br />
O Lord, save thy people, * and bless thine heritage.<br />
Govern them, * and lift them up for ever.<br />
Day by day * we magnify thee;<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">During the following verse, by local custom, all make a profound bow.</span><br />
And we worship thy Name * ever, world without end.<br />
 <br />
Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us * this day without sin.<br />
O Lord, have mercy upon us, * have mercy upon us.<br />
O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us, * as our trust is in thee.<br />
O Lord, in thee have I trusted, * let me never be confounded.<br />
