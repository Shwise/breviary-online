<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">A</i>ll ye who would the Christ descry,<br />
Lift up your eyes to him on high:<br />
There mortal gaze hath strength to see<br />
The token of his majesty.<br />
 <br />
A wondrous sign we there behold,<br />
That knows not death nor groweth old,<br />
Sublime, most high, that cannot fade,<br />
That was ere earth and heaven were made.<br />
 <br />
Here is the King the gentiles fear,<br />
The Jews' most mighty King is here<br />
Promised to Abraham of yore,<br />
And to his seed forevermore.<br />
 <br />
'Tis he the prophets' words foretold,<br />
And by their signs shown forth of old;<br />
The Father's witness hath ordained<br />
That we should hear with faith unfeigned.<br />
 <br />
Jesu, to thee our praise we pay,<br />
To little ones revealed today,<br />
With Father and blest Spirit One<br />
Until the ages' course is done.<br />
Amen.<br />

From the Sermons of Pope St. Leo <span class="w">the Great.</span><br />
<span class="ri">On the Transfiguration.</span><br />
The Lord taketh chosen witnesses, and in their presence, revealeth His glory. That form of body which He had in common with other men, He so transfigured with light, that His Face did shine as the sun, and His raiment became exceeding white as snow. Of this metamorphosis the chief work was to remove from the hearts of the disciples the stumbling at the Cross. Before their eyes was unveiled the splendour of His hidden majesty, that the lowliness of His freely-chosen suffering might not confound their faith. But none the less was there here laid by the Providence of God a solid foundation for the hope of the Holy Church, whereby the whole body of Christ should know with what a change it is yet to be honoured. The members of that body whose Head hath already been transfigured in light may promise themselves a share in His glory.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They were abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house, and<br />
* Thou madest them drink of the river of thy pleasures.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For with thee is the fountain of life, and in thy light shall we see light.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And Thou madest them drink of the river of thy pleasures.<br />

For the strengthening the Apostles and bringing them forward into all knowledge, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias that is, the Law and the Prophets talking with Him. Before five witnesses did His glorification take place, as though to fulfill that which is written: At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established. <span class="w">Deut. xix. 15.</span> What can be more certain, what can be better attested than this matter, which is proclaimed by the trumpets of both the Old and the New Testaments, and concerning which the witness of ancient testimony uniteth with the teaching of the Gospel The pages of either Covenant strengthen one another, and the brightness of open glory maketh manifest and distinct Him Whom the former prophecies had promised under the veil of mysteries.<br />

<b>Reading 6</b><br />
The unveiling of such mysteries roused the mind of the Apostle Peter to an outburst of longing for the things eternal, which despised and disdained the things worldly and earthly overflowing with gladness at the vision, he yearned to dwell with Jesus there, where the revelation of His glory had rejoiced him. And so he said Master, it is good for us to be here if Thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. To this proposal the Lord answered nothing, this signifying, that what Peter wished was not wrong, but out of place, since the world could not be saved but by the death of Christ. And the Lord's example was to call the faith of believers to this, that albeit we are behoven to have no doubts concerning the promise of eternal blessedness, yet we are to understand that, amid the trials of this life, we are to seek for endurance before glory.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> If the ministration of death, written and engraven on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance which is done away:<br />
* How shall not the ministration of the Spirit, which abideth, be rather glorious?<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For Christ was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 17:1-9</span><br />
At that time: Jesus took Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brought them up into an high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. John Chrysostom (Patriarch of Constantinople.)<br />
<span class="ri">57th on Matthew.</span><br />
Since the Lord had spoken much concerning dangers, much concerning His Own sufferings, much concerning death, and the killing of His disciples, and had laid upon them many hard and grievous things, and since all these were in this present life, and already hanging over them, whereas the good things were matter for hope and waiting as, for example, that whosoever should lose his life for His sake should find it, for that the Son of Man should come in the glory of His Father, and reward every man according to his works. <span class="w">Matth. xvi. 25, 27.</span> Therefore, to assure them by their own eyes, and show them what the glory is wherein He will come, He manifested and unveiled it to them, as far as in this life they were able to grasp it, lest they and especially Peter should grieve over their own deaths, or the death of their Lord.<br />

Behold what He doth, when He treateth of heaven and hell. Where He saith Whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall find it. And again He shall reward every man according to his works in these words He pointeth at heaven and hell. But although He speaketh concerning both, He giveth a glimpse of heaven only and not of hell. To see hell would have profited the brutish and stupid, but His disciples were upright and clear-sighted, and therefore for them it was enough to be strengthened by the better things. This was what suited Him the best. Yet He left not the other altogether undone. Sometimes He set the horrors of hell, as it were, before the eyes, as for instance in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, and that of him who was fain to wring the hundred pence from his fellow-servant.<br />

But mark well Matthew's good will, in not concealing the names of those who were preferred. John also likewise often recordeth the special praises of Peter with great truthfulness and care. For in this companionship of the Apostles, there was no envy, nor did vainglory find place. It was therefore the leaders of the Apostles whom Christ took apart from the others. And wherefore did he take these only? Because there were evidently superior to the rest. And why did he not do this straightway, and not until after six days? Evidently to spare the natural feelings of the other disciples; and for the same reason Christ did not for six days announce who were to go up.<br />
