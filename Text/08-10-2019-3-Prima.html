<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">93:1</span>  The Lord is the God to whom revenge belongeth: * the God of revenge hath acted freely.<br />
<span class="w">93:2</span>  Lift up thyself, thou that judgest the earth: * render a reward to the proud.<br />
<span class="w">93:3</span>  How long shall sinners, O Lord: * how long shall sinners glory?<br />
<span class="w">93:4</span>  Shall they utter, and speak iniquity: * shall all speak who work injustice?<br />
<span class="w">93:5</span>  Thy people, O Lord, they have brought low: * and they have afflicted thy inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">93:6</span>  They have slain the widow and the stranger: * and they have murdered the fatherless.<br />
<span class="w">93:7</span>  And they have said: The Lord shall not see: * neither shall the God of Jacob understand.<br />
<span class="w">93:8</span>  Understand, ye senseless among the people: * and, you fools, be wise at last.<br />
<span class="w">93:9</span>  He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? * or he that formed the eye, doth he not consider?<br />
<span class="w">93:10</span>  He that chastiseth nations, shall he not rebuke: * he that teacheth man knowledge?<br />
<span class="w">93:11</span>  The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, * that they are vain.<br />

<span class="w">93:13</span>  That thou mayst give him rest from the evil days: * till a pit be dug for the wicked.<br />
<span class="w">93:14</span>  For the Lord will not cast off his people: * neither will he forsake his own inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">93:15</span>  Until justice be turned into judgment: * and they that are near it are all the upright in heart.<br />
<span class="w">93:16</span>  Who shall rise up for me against the evildoers? * or who shall stand with me against the workers of iniquity?<br />
<span class="w">93:17</span>  Unless the Lord had been my helper, * my soul had almost dwelt in hell.<br />
<span class="w">93:18</span>  If I said: My foot is moved: * thy mercy, O Lord, assisted me.<br />
<span class="w">93:19</span>  According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, * thy comforts have given joy to my soul.<br />
<span class="w">93:20</span>  Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee, * who framest labour in commandment?<br />
<span class="w">93:21</span>  They will hunt after the soul of the just, * and will condemn innocent blood.<br />
<span class="w">93:22</span>  But the Lord is my refuge: * and my God the help of my hope.<br />
<span class="w">93:23</span>  And he will render them their iniquity: and in their malice he will destroy them: * the Lord our God will destroy them.<br />

<span class="w">107:3</span>  Arise, my glory; arise, psaltery and harp * I will arise in the morning early.<br />
<span class="w">107:4</span>  I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: * and I will sing unto thee among the nations.<br />
<span class="w">107:5</span>  For thy mercy is great above the heavens: * and thy truth even unto the clouds.<br />
<span class="w">107:6</span>  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory over all the earth: * that thy beloved may be delivered.<br />
<span class="w">107:7</span>  Save with thy right hand and hear me. * God hath spoken in his holiness.<br />

<span class="w">107:10</span>  Juda is my king: * Moab the pot of my hope.<br />
<span class="w">107:10</span>  Over Edom I will stretch out my shoe: * the aliens are become my friends.<br />
<span class="w">107:11</span>  Who will bring me into the strong city? * who will lead me into Edom?<br />
<span class="w">107:12</span>  Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? * and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our armies?<br />
<span class="w">107:13</span>  O grant us help from trouble: * for vain is the help of man.<br />
<span class="w">107:14</span>  Through God we shall do mightily: * and he will bring our enemies to nothing.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<b>A</b>t Rome, [in the year 286,] between the two Laurel trees, the holy martyr Tiburtius. In the persecution under the Emperor Diocletian the judge Fabian caused him to walk with bare feet upon burning coals, and as he confessed Christ all the more firmly, commanded him to be led to the third mile-stone outside the city, and there beheaded. <br />
<b>L</b>ikewise at Rome, [in the year 295,] the holy Virgin Susanna, a damsel of noble birth, a niece to blessed Pope Caius. She was beheaded in the time of the Emperor Diocletian, and so gained the palm of martyrdom. <br />
<b>A</b>t Comana, in Pontus, [in the year 250,] holy Alexander, Bishop of that city, surnamed the charcoal-burner. He was a most learned philosopher, who learnt to be eminent for humility as a Christian. He was raised by holy Gregory the wonder-worker to fill that see, and was illustrious not only for his preaching but because he suffered martyrdom by fire. <br />
<b>U</b>pon the same day, under the Emperor Maximinus, [in the fourth century,] the holy martyr Rufinus, Bishop of the Marsi, and his Companions. <br />
<b>A</b>t Évreux, [in the fifth century,] the holy Confessor Taurinus, who was ordained [first] Bishop of that city by blessed Pope Clement. He spread the Christian faith by his preaching of the gospel, and after much labour for that end fell asleep in the Lord, famous for miracles. <br />
<b>A</b>t Cambrai, in Gaul, [in the year 614,] the holy Confessor Gaugeric [St. Géry], Bishop of that see. <br />
