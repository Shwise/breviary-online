<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">2 Cor 9:6</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>rethren: He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i> God, of those that fought thy fight,<br />
Portion, and prize, and crown of light,<br />
Break every bond of sin and shame<br />
As now we praise thy martyr's name.<br />
 <br />
He recked not of the world's allure,<br />
But sin and pomp of sin forswore:<br />
Knew all their gall, and passed them by,<br />
And reached the throne prepared on high.<br />
 <br />
Bravely the course of pain he ran,<br />
And bare his torments as a man:<br />
For love of thee his blood outpoured,<br />
And thus obtained the great reward.<br />
 <br />
With humble voice and suppliant word<br />
We pray thee therefore, holy Lord,<br />
While we thy martyr's feast-day keep,<br />
Forgive thy loved and erring sheep.<br />
 <br />
* Glory and praise for aye be done<br />
To God the Father, and the Son,<br />
And Holy Ghost, who reign on high,<br />
One God, to all eternity.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />

<span class="w">1:47</span> And my spirit hath rejoiced * in God my Saviour.<br />

<span class="w">1:53</span> He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
<span class="w">1:54</span> He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy:<br />
