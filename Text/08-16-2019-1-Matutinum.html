<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>his the confessor of the Lord, whose triumph<br />
Now all the faithful celebrate, with gladness<br />
On this feast day year by year receiveth<br />
Merited honors.<br />
 <br />
Saintly and prudent, modest in behaviour,<br />
Peaceful and sober, chaste was he, and lowly.<br />
While that life’s vigour, coursing through his members,<br />
Quickened his being.<br />
 <br />
Sick ones of old time, to his tomb resorting,<br />
Sorely by ailments manifold afflicted,<br />
Oft-times have welcomed health and strength returning,<br />
At his petition.<br />
 <br />
Whence we in chorus gladly do him honour,<br />
Chanting his praises with devout affection,<br />
That in his merits we may have a portion,<br />
Now and forever.<br />
 <br />
His be the glory, power and salvation,<br />
Who over all things reigneth in the highest,<br />
Earth’s mighty fabric ruling and directing,<br />
Onely and Trinal.<br />
Amen.<br />

From the Sermons of St. Epiphanius, Bishop <span class="w">of Pavia.</span><br />
From the Root of Jesse sprang King David, and from the stock of King David, the Holy Virgin. Holy I call her, and the daughter of holy men. Her father and mother were Joachim and Anne, who pleased God in their lives, and brought forth an offspring well pleasing to Him, even the Holy Virgin Mary, at once the Temple and the Mother of God. These three, Joachim, Anne, and Mary, clearly offered up unto the Trinity a sacrifice of praise. For the name Joachim being interpreted, signifieth "the preparation of the Lord", and out of him was prepared the Temple of the Lord, namely, the Virgin. The name Anne signifieth grace, and she and Joachim did indeed receive a grace when, in answer to their prayers, they generated such an offspring, compassing the Holy Virgin. Joachim prayed upon the mountain and Anne in her garden.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> The Lord made him honourable, and defended him from his enemies, and kept him safe from those that lay in wait for him;<br />

<span class="ri">1st on the Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</span><br />
Since it was to be that the Virgin Mother of God should be born of Anne, nature dared not to produce any other child before this child of grace, but humbly waited until grace should have produced her's. It behoved that she should come into the world as a first-born, who was to bear the First-born of every creature, even Him by Whom all things were made. O blessed couple, Joachim and Anne unto you is all creation laid under debt, since through you creation hath offered to the Creator this noblest of gifts, namely, that chaste mother, who alone was worthy of the Creator.<br />

Rejoice, O Joachim, from whose daughter a Child hath unto us been born, and His name is called The Angel of the Great Counsel, that is, of the salvation of the whole world. Let Nestorius be ashamed, and put his hand upon his mouth. Her Child is God. How then can His Mother be other than Mother of God? Whosoever acknowledgeth not the Holy Mother of God is far from God. This saying is not mine, although it is mine in all other senses than that of authority. I have received it as a most godly legacy from Father Gregory the Divine. O blessed couple, Joachim and Anne. Christ saith in a certain place By their fruits ye shall know them <span class="w">Matth. iii. 20</span> and ye are known by the fruit of your chaste loins. That that which should be born of you might be worthy and wellpleasing in the sight of God, ye ordered your own lives by rule. In the chaste and holy exercise of your natural gift, ye produced the treasure of virginity.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 1:1-16</span><br />
The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. John of Damascus.<br />
<span class="ri">Bk. iv. on the Orthodox Faith.</span><br />
That Joseph sprang from the lineage of David, the most holy Evangelists Matthew and Luke have clearly shown. There is this difference between them, that Matthew traceth the pedigree from David through Solomon, and Luke through Nathan. But both of them pass in silence over the descent of the Holy Virgin. In explanation of this we shall find on investigation that among the Jews, and in the Holy Scriptures, it hath never been in use to chronicle the pedigrees of women. But the Law containeth a warning against the tribes intermarrying one with another. Joseph was of the same tribe as David, <span class="w">namely, Judah,</span> and since he was a just man (this is the praise which the Gospel of God giveth him,) he would not have espoused the Holy Virgin, unless she had been of the same race, as such an union would not have been in accordance with the commandment of the law. For this reason the Evangelist held it enough to have shown the descent of Joseph.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> This is he which wrought great wonders before God, and praised the Lord with all his heart.<br />
* May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Behold a man without blame, a worshipper of God in truth, keeping himself clean from every evil work, and abiding still in his innocency.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> May he pray for all people, that their sins may be forgiven unto them.<br />

Therefore, from the stock of Nathan the son of David, Levi begat Melchi and Panther and Panther begat Bar-Panther (for so was he called) and Bar-Panther begat Joachim and Joachim begat the Holy Mother of God. Again, from the stock of Solomon the son of David, Mathan of his wife begat Jacob. And after Mathan was dead, Melchi, of the family of Nathan, son to Levi and brother to Panther, took to him in marriage her that had been the wife of Mathan, and was mother of Jacob, and begat of her Heli. So that Jacob and Heli were half-brothers, sons of the same mother, but one of the stock of Solomon and the other of the stock of Nathan.<br />

Then Heli, who was the descendant of Nathan, died, having had no children. Whereupon, Jacob, who was the descendant of Solomon, took to himself the widow of his halfbrother Heli, to raise up seed unto his brother, and begat of her Joseph. So Joseph was by nature the son of Jacob the descendant of Solomon, but in the eye of the Law he had for his father Heli the descendant of Nathan. Things being thus, Joachim took to wife that most eminent and praiseworthy woman, Anne. And even as the patient Hannah, being stricken with barrenness, by prayer and promise became the mother of Samuel, so likewise this woman also through prayer and promise received from God the Mother of God, that in fruitfulness she might not be behind any of the famous matrons. And thus grace (for such is the signification of the name of Anne) is mother of the Lady (for such is the signification of the name of Mary. ) And indeed she became the Lady of every creature, since she hath been mother of the Creator.<br />
