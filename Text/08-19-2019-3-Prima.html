<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">18:14</span>  If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />

<b>I</b>n Judea, [in the year 1043 before Christ,] the holy Prophet Samuel, whose sacred bones, as writeth blessed Jerome, were carried to Constantinople by the Emperor Arcadius, and laid near the Hebdomon. <br />
<b>O</b>n the same day, [in the fourth century,] the holy Senator Lucius. He was turned to the faith of Christ by seeing the constancy with which Theodore, Bishop of Cyrene, underwent martyrdom, and drew the President Dignian to the same belief; they went together to Cyprus, and when he saw other Christians there being crowned for confessing the Lord, he thrust himself forward and gained the same crown of martyrdom by being beheaded. <br />
<b>I</b>n Thrace, thirty-seven holy martyrs, who under the President Apellian, for Christ's faith's sake, had their hands and feet cut off, and were cast into a furnace of fire. Likewise the holy martyrs Severus and Memnon the centurion, who finished their testimony by the same kind of death, and departed to heaven as conquerors. <br />
<b>A</b>t Cordova, [in the year 852,] the holy martyrs Leovigild and Christopher. They were monks who were cast into prison for their defence of the Christian faith in the persecution under the Arabs, and were presently beheaded, and so gained the palm of martyrdom, whereafter their bodies were burnt. <br />
<b>A</b>t Rome, [in the third century,] blessed Porphyry, a man of God, from whom the holy martyr Agapitus learnt the faith and teaching of Christ. <br />
