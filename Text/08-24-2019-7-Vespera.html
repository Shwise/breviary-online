<span class="ri">Psalm 138</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">138:1</span>  Lord, thou hast proved me, and known me: * thou hast known my sitting down, and my rising up.<br />
<span class="w">138:3</span>  Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off: * my path and my life thou hast searched out.<br />
<span class="w">138:4</span>  And thou hast foreseen all my ways: * for there is no speech on my tongue.<br />
<span class="w">138:5</span>  Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, the last and those of old: * thou hast formed me, and hast laid thy hand upon me.<br />
<span class="w">138:6</span>  Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me: * it is high, and I cannot reach to it.<br />
<span class="w">138:7</span>  Whither shall I go from thy spirit? * or whither shall I flee from thy face?<br />
<span class="w">138:8</span>  If I ascend into heaven, thou art there: * if I descend into hell, thou art present.<br />
<span class="w">138:9</span>  If I take my wings early in the morning, * and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea:<br />
<span class="w">138:10</span>  Even there also shall thy hand lead me: * and thy right hand shall hold me.<br />
<span class="w">138:11</span>  And I said: Perhaps darkness shall cover me: * and night shall be my light in my pleasures.<br />
<span class="w">138:12</span>  But darkness shall not be dark to thee, and night shall be light as the day: * the darkness thereof, and the light thereof are alike to thee.<br />
<span class="w">138:13</span>  For thou hast possessed my reins: * thou hast protected me from my motherâ€™s womb.<br />
<span class="w">138:14</span>  I will praise thee, for thou art fearfully magnified: * wonderful are thy works, and my soul knoweth right well.<br />
<span class="w">138:15</span>  My bone is not hidden from thee, which thou hast made in secret: * and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">138:16</span>  Thy eyes did see my imperfect being, and in thy book all shall be written: * days shall be formed, and no one in them<br />
<span class="w">138:17</span>  But to me thy friends, O God, are made exceedingly honourable: * their principality is exceedingly strengthened.<br />
<span class="w">138:18</span>  I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand: * I rose up and am still with thee.<br />
<span class="w">138:19</span>  If thou wilt kill the wicked, O God: * ye men of blood, depart from me:<br />
<span class="w">138:20</span>  Because you say in thought: * They shall receive thy cities in vain.<br />
<span class="w">138:21</span>  Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated thee: * and pined away because of thy enemies?<br />
<span class="w">138:22</span>  I have hated them with a perfect hatred: * and they are become enemies to me.<br />
<span class="w">138:23</span>  Prove me, O God, and know my heart: * examine me, and know my paths.<br />
<span class="w">138:24</span>  And see if there be in me the way of iniquity: * and lead me in the eternal way.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<br />
<span class="ri">Eph 2:19-20</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>rothers: Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners; but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and the domestics of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow let the earth with joy resound,<br />
And heaven the chant re-echo round;<br />
Nor heaven nor earth too high can raise<br />
The great Apostles' glorious praise.<br />
 <br />
O ye who, throned in glory dread,<br />
Shall judge the living and the dead,<br />
Lights of the world forevermore!<br />
To you the suppliant prayer we pour.<br />
 <br />
Ye close the sacred gates on high;<br />
At your command apart they fly:<br />
Oh! loose for us the guilty chain<br />
We strive to break, and strive in vain.<br />
 <br />
Sickness and health your voice obey;<br />
At your command they go or stay:<br />
From sin's disease our souls restore;<br />
In good confirm us more and more.<br />
 <br />
So when the world is at its end,<br />
And Christ to judgement shall descend,<br />
May we be called those joys to see<br />
Prepared from all eternity.<br />
 <br />
* Praise to the Father, with the Son,<br />
And Holy Spirit, Three in One;<br />
As ever was in ages past,<br />
And so shall be while ages last.<br />
Amen.<br />
