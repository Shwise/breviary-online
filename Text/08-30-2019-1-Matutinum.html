<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>on of a virgin, maker of thy mother,<br />
Thou, rod and blossom from a stem unstain√®d,<br />
Now while a virgin fair of fame we honour,<br />
Hear our devotion!<br />
 <br />
Fountain of mercy, hear the prayers she offers;<br />
Purge our offences, pardon our transgressions,<br />
So that hereafter we to thee may render<br />
Praise with thanksgiving.<br />
 <br />
Thou, the All-Father, thou, the One-Begotten,<br />
Thou, Holy Spirit, Three in One co-equal,<br />
Glory be henceforth thine through all the ages,<br />
World without ending.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord set up a testimony in Jacob: * and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(1-8)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:1</span>  Attend, O my people, to my law: * incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">77:2</span>  I will open my mouth in parables: * I will utter propositions from the beginning.<br />
<span class="w">77:3</span>  How great things have we heard and known, * and our fathers have told us.<br />
<span class="w">77:4</span>  They have not been hidden from their children, * in another generation.<br />
<span class="w">77:4</span>  Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, * and his wonders which he hath done.<br />
<span class="w">77:5</span>  And he set up a testimony in Jacob: * and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="w">77:5</span>  How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: * that another generation might know them.<br />
<span class="w">77:6</span>  The children that should be born and should rise up, * and declare them to their children.<br />
<span class="w">77:7</span>  That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: * and may seek his commandments.<br />
<span class="w">77:8</span>  That they may not become like their fathers, * a perverse and exasperating generation.<br />
<span class="w">77:8</span>  A generation that set not their heart aright: * and whose spirit was not faithful to God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord did wonderful things * in the sight of their fathers.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(9-16)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:9</span>  The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: * they have turned back in the day of battle.<br />
<span class="w">77:10</span>  They kept not the covenant of God: * and in his law they would not walk.<br />
<span class="w">77:11</span>  And they forgot his benefits, * and his wonders that he had shewn them.<br />
<span class="w">77:12</span>  Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, * in the field of Tanis.<br />
<span class="w">77:13</span>  He divided the sea and brought them through: * and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.<br />
<span class="w">77:14</span>  And he conducted them with a cloud by day: * and all the night with a light of fire.<br />
<span class="w">77:15</span>  He struck the rock in the wilderness: * and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.<br />
<span class="w">77:16</span>  He brought forth water out of the rock: * and made streams run down as rivers.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord did wonderful things in the sight of their fathers.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord opened * the doors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(17-31)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:17</span>  And they added yet more sin against him: * they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.<br />
<span class="w">77:18</span>  And they tempted God in their hearts, * by asking meat for their desires.<br />
<span class="w">77:19</span>  And they spoke ill of God: * they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?<br />
<span class="w">77:20</span>  Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, * and the streams overflowed.<br />
<span class="w">77:20</span>  Can he also give bread, * or provide a table for his people?<br />
<span class="w">77:21</span>  Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: * and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.<br />
<span class="w">77:22</span>  Because they believed not in God: * and trusted not in his salvation.<br />
<span class="w">77:23</span>  And he had commanded the clouds from above, * and had opened the doors of heaven.<br />
<span class="w">77:24</span>  And had rained down manna upon them to eat, * and had given them the bread of heaven.<br />
<span class="w">77:25</span>  Man ate the bread of angels: * he sent them provisions in abundance.<br />
<span class="w">77:26</span>  He removed the south wind from heaven: * and by his power brought in the southwest wind.<br />
<span class="w">77:27</span>  And he rained upon them flesh as dust: * and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.<br />
<span class="w">77:28</span>  And they fell in the midst of their camp, * round about their pavilions.<br />
<span class="w">77:29</span>  So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: * they were not defrauded of that which they craved.<br />
<span class="w">77:30</span>  As yet their meat was in their mouth: * and the wrath of God came upon them.<br />
<span class="w">77:31</span>  And he slew the fat ones amongst them, * and brought down the chosen men of Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord opened the doors of heaven and had rained down manna upon them to eat.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> God is their helper, * and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(32-41)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:32</span>  In all these things they sinned still: * and they believed not for his wondrous works.<br />
<span class="w">77:33</span>  And their days were consumed in vanity, * and their years in haste.<br />
<span class="w">77:34</span>  When he slew them, then they sought him: * and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.<br />
<span class="w">77:35</span>  And they remembered that God was their helper: * and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="w">77:36</span>  And they loved him with their mouth: * and with their tongue they lied unto him:<br />
<span class="w">77:37</span>  But their heart was not right with him: * nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.<br />
<span class="w">77:38</span>  But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: * and will not destroy them.<br />
<span class="w">77:38</span>  And many a time did he turn away his anger: * and did not kindle all his wrath.<br />
<span class="w">77:39</span>  And he remembered that they are flesh: * a wind that goeth and returneth not.<br />
<span class="w">77:40</span>  How often did they provoke him in the desert: * and move him to wrath in the place without water?<br />
<span class="w">77:41</span>  And they turned back and tempted God: * and grieved the holy one of Israel.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> God is their helper, and the most high God their redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord redeemed them * from the hand of him that afflicted them.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(42-58)</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:42</span>  They remembered not his hand, * in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:<br />
<span class="w">77:43</span>  How he wrought his signs in Egypt, * and his wonders in the field of Tanis.<br />
<span class="w">77:44</span>  And he turned their rivers into blood, * and their showers that they might, not drink.<br />
<span class="w">77:45</span>  He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them: * and frogs which destroyed them.<br />
<span class="w">77:46</span>  And he gave up their fruits to the blast, * and their labours to the locust.<br />
<span class="w">77:47</span>  And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, * and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.<br />
<span class="w">77:48</span>  And he gave up their cattle to the hail, * and their stock to the fire.<br />
<span class="w">77:49</span>  And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: * indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.<br />
<span class="w">77:50</span>  He made a way for a path to his anger: * he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.<br />
<span class="w">77:51</span>  And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: * the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.<br />
<span class="w">77:52</span>  And he took away his own people as sheep: * and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br />
<span class="w">77:53</span>  And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: * and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br />
<span class="w">77:54</span>  And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: * the mountain which his right hand had purchased.<br />
<span class="w">77:54</span>  And he cast out the Gentiles before them: * and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.<br />
<span class="w">77:55</span>  And he made the tribes of Israel * to dwell in their tabernacles.<br />
<span class="w">77:56</span>  Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: * and they kept not his testimonies.<br />
<span class="w">77:57</span>  And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: * even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.<br />
<span class="w">77:58</span>  They provoked him to anger on their hills: * and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> God built * his sanctuary in the earth.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 77(59-72)</span><em> [6]</em><br />
<span class="w">77:59</span>  God heard, and despised them, * and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.<br />
<span class="w">77:60</span>  And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, * his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.<br />
<span class="w">77:61</span>  And he delivered their strength into captivity: * and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.<br />
<span class="w">77:62</span>  And he shut up his people under the sword: * and he despised his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">77:63</span>  Fire consumed their young men: * and their maidens were not lamented.<br />
<span class="w">77:64</span>  Their priests fell by the sword: * and their widows did not mourn.<br />
<span class="w">77:65</span>  And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, * and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.<br />
<span class="w">77:66</span>  And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: * he put them to an everlasting reproach.<br />
<span class="w">77:67</span>  And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: * and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:<br />
<span class="w">77:68</span>  But he chose the tribe of Juda, * mount Sion which he loved.<br />
<span class="w">77:69</span>  And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land * which he founded for ever.<br />
<span class="w">77:70</span>  And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: * he brought him from following the ewes great with young,<br />
<span class="w">77:71</span>  To feed Jacob his servant, * and Israel his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">77:72</span>  And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: * and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 78</span><em> [7]</em><br />
<span class="w">78:1</span>  O God, the heathens are come into thy inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: * they have made Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit.<br />
<span class="w">78:2</span>  They have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: * the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">78:3</span>  They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem, * and there was none to bury them.<br />
<span class="w">78:4</span>  We are become a reproach to our neighbours: * a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.<br />

<span class="w">80:4</span>  Blow up the trumpet on the new moon, * on the noted day of your solemnity.<br />
<span class="w">80:5</span>  For it is a commandment in Israel, * and a judgment to the God of Jacob.<br />
<span class="w">80:6</span>  He ordained it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the land of Egypt: * he heard a tongue which he knew not.<br />
<span class="w">80:7</span>  He removed his back from the burdens: * his hands had served in baskets.<br />
<span class="w">80:8</span>  Thou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee: * I heard thee in the secret place of tempest: I proved thee at the waters of contradiction.<br />

<span class="w">5</span> Turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger: and leave not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy back.<br />

The first flower of holiness in South America was the maiden Rose. She was born of Christian parents at Lima and in her cradle early gave signs of her future sanctity, for the child's face was wonderfully transformed into the likeness of a rose, and this gave her her name. Lest she be compelled by her parents to marry, she secretly cut off her lovely hair. The austerity of her life was most singular. She took the habit of the Third Order of St. Dominic and followed the difficult path of St. Catherine of Siena. For fifteen years, she would suffer terribly for hours at a time from desolation of spirit and from aridity, and bravely bore agonies more bitter than any death. Through frequent apparitions, she enjoyed a wonderful companionship with her Guardian Angel, St. Catherine of Siena, and the Virgin Mother of God, and she was privileged to hear Christ say these words, Rose of my Heart, be thou my bride. Famous for many miracles both before and after her death, she was enrolled in the list of holy Virgins by Pope Clement X.<br />
