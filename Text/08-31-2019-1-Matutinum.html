<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>his the confessor of the Lord, whose triumph<br />
Now all the faithful celebrate, with gladness<br />
On this feast day year by year receiveth<br />
Merited honors.<br />
 <br />
Saintly and prudent, modest in behaviour,<br />
Peaceful and sober, chaste was he, and lowly.<br />
While that life’s vigour, coursing through his members,<br />
Quickened his being.<br />
 <br />
Sick ones of old time, to his tomb resorting,<br />
Sorely by ailments manifold afflicted,<br />
Oft-times have welcomed health and strength returning,<br />
At his petition.<br />
 <br />
Whence we in chorus gladly do him honour,<br />
Chanting his praises with devout affection,<br />
That in his merits we may have a portion,<br />
Now and forever.<br />
 <br />
His be the glory, power and salvation,<br />
Who over all things reigneth in the highest,<br />
Earth’s mighty fabric ruling and directing,<br />
Onely and Trinal.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">104:10</span>  And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, * and to Israel for an everlasting testament:<br />
<span class="w">104:11</span>  Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, * the lot of your inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">104:12</span>  When they were but a small number: * yea very few, and sojourners therein:<br />
<span class="w">104:13</span>  And they passed from nation to nation, * and from one kingdom to another people.<br />
<span class="w">104:14</span>  He suffered no man to hurt them: * and he reproved kings for their sakes.<br />

<span class="w">104:17</span>  He sent a man before them: * Joseph, who was sold for a slave.<br />
<span class="w">104:18</span>  They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul, * until his word came.<br />
<span class="w">104:19</span>  The word of the Lord inflamed him: * the king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty.<br />
<span class="w">104:21</span>  He made him master of his house, * and ruler of all his possession.<br />
<span class="w">104:22</span>  That he might instruct his princes as himself, * and teach his ancients wisdom.<br />

<span class="w">104:26</span>  He sent Moses his servant: * Aaron the man whom he had chosen.<br />
<span class="w">104:27</span>  He gave them power to shew his signs, * and his wonders in the land of Cham.<br />

<span class="w">104:29</span>  He turned their waters into blood, * and destroyed their fish.<br />
<span class="w">104:30</span>  Their land brought forth frogs, * in the inner chambers of their kings.<br />
<span class="w">104:31</span>  He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies, * and sciniphs in all their coasts.<br />
<span class="w">104:32</span>  He gave them hail for rain, * a burning fire in the land.<br />
<span class="w">104:33</span>  And he destroyed their vineyards, and their fig trees: * and he broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.<br />
<span class="w">104:34</span>  He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, * of which there was no number.<br />
<span class="w">104:35</span>  And they devoured all the grass in their land, * and consumed all the fruit of their ground.<br />

<span class="w">104:37</span>  And he brought them out with silver and gold: * and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble.<br />
<span class="w">104:38</span>  Egypt was glad when they departed: * for the fear of them lay upon them.<br />
<span class="w">104:39</span>  He spread a cloud for their protection, * and fire to give them light in the night.<br />
<span class="w">104:40</span>  They asked, and the quail came: * and he filled them with the bread of heaven.<br />

<span class="w">105:39</span>  And the land was polluted with blood, and was defiled with their works: * and they went aside after their own inventions.<br />
<span class="w">105:40</span>  And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: * and he abhorred his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">105:41</span>  And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: * and they that hated them had dominion over them.<br />

Lesson from the book of Ecclesiasticus<br />
<span class="ri">Sir 4:23-28</span><br />
<span class="w">23</span> Son, observe the time, and fly from evil.<br />
<span class="w">24</span> For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth.<br />
<span class="w">25</span> For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that bringeth glory and grace.<br />
<span class="w">26</span> Accept no person against thy own person, nor against thy soul a lie.<br />
<span class="w">27</span> Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall:<br />
<span class="w">28</span> And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O Lord, Father and God of my life, leave me not to evil counsels; give me not a proud look, but turn away from me an haughty mind, O Lord turn away from me concupiscence,<br />
* And give me not over unto an impudent and froward mind, O Lord!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Leave me not, O Lord, lest mine ignorance increase, and my sins abound.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And give me not over unto an impudent and froward mind, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>He whose feast-day we are keeping, be our Advocate with God. Amen. <br />

<span class="ri">Sir 4:29-32</span><br />
<span class="w">29</span> For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding, and knowledge, and learning by the word of the wise, and steadfastness in the works of justice.<br />
<span class="w">30</span> In nowise speak against the truth, but be ashamed of the lie of thy ignorance.<br />
<span class="w">31</span> Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, but submit not thyself to every man for sin.<br />
<span class="w">32</span> Resist not against the face of the mighty, and do not strive against the stream of the river<br />
<span class="ri">Sir 4:33-36</span><br />
<span class="w">33</span> Strive for justice for thy soul, and even unto death fight for justice, and God will overthrow thy enemies for thee.<br />
<span class="w">34</span> Be not hasty in thy tongue: and slack and remiss in thy works.<br />
<span class="w">35</span> Be not as a lion in thy house, terrifying them of thy household, and oppressing them that are under thee.<br />
<span class="w">36</span> Let not thy hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou shouldst give.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> Lord, thine eyes behold all that is in the heart of man, and in thy book are they all written.<br />
* Man looketh on the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For He searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Man looketh on the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />

Raymund was called Nonnatus, or Unborn, because he was brought into life from the side of his dead mother contrary to the common law of nature. He scorned childish games and the temptations of the world and gave himself to works of devotion so that all admired the boy as having the virtues of a mature man. He loved the Mother of God above all and constantly prayed to her. He entered the religious Order called that of Ransom, or of Mercy, for the ransom of captives. He perpetually kept his virginity, which he had already consecrated to the Blessed Virgin, and shone with the other virtues, especially with charity toward the Christians who were living wretched lives under the power of pagans. Gregory IX enrolled him among the Cardinals; but the man of God shrank from all pomp and always held most firmly to the humility proper to a religious. At Cardona, worn out by his last illness and fortified by the Sacraments of the Church, he went to the Lord on the last Sunday of August in the year 1240.<br />
