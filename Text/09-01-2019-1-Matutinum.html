<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow, from the slumbers of the night arising, <br />
Chant we the holy psalmody of David,<br />
Hymns to our Master, with a voice concordant,<br />
Sweetly intoning.<br />
 <br />
So may our Monarch pitifully hear us,<br />
That we may merit with his saints to enter<br />
Mansions eternal, therewithal possessing<br />
Joy beatific.<br />
 <br />
This be our portion, God forever blessed,<br />
Father eternal, Son, and Holy Spirit,<br />
Whose is the glory, which through all creation<br />
Ever resoundeth.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 2</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">2:1</span>  Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?<br />

<span class="w">3:5</span>  I have cried to the Lord with my voice: * and he hath heard me from his holy hill.<br />
<span class="w">3:6</span>  I have slept and taken my rest: * and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.<br />
<span class="w">3:7</span>  I will not fear thousands of the people, surrounding me: * arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.<br />

<span class="w">8:3</span>  Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise, because of thy enemies, * that thou mayst destroy the enemy and the avenger.<br />
<span class="w">8:4</span>  For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: * the moon and the stars which thou hast founded.<br />

Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest <span class="w">at Jarrow.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Bk. iii. ch. 43 on Luke x.</span><br />
Blessed were the eyes not of Scribes and Pharisees, which saw but the Body of the Lord, but those eyes, eyes blessed indeed, which were able to see those things whereof it is written "Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes." Blessed are the eyes of those little ones unto whom it seemeth good in the eyes of the Son to reveal Himself and the Father also. Abraham rejoiced to see the day of Christ and he saw it, and was glad. <span class="w">John viii. 56.</span> Isaiah, and Micah, and many among the Prophets, saw the glory of the Lord, wherefore also they be called Seers, but all they beheld it and hailed it afar off, seeing but as through a glass, darkly. <span class="w">1 Cor. xiii. 12.</span><br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />

 <br />
<span class="ri">During the following verse all make a profound bow:</span><br />
When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man, * thou didst not abhor the Virgin's womb.<br />
 <br />
When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, * thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.<br />
Thou sittest at the right hand of God, * in the glory of the Father.<br />
We believe that thou shalt come * to be our Judge.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Kneel for the following verse</span><br />
We therefore pray thee, help thy servants, * whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious Blood.<br />
 <br />
Make them to be numbered with thy Saints, * in glory everlasting.<br />
O Lord, save thy people, * and bless thine heritage.<br />
Govern them, * and lift them up for ever.<br />
Day by day * we magnify thee;<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">During the following verse, by local custom, all make a profound bow.</span><br />
And we worship thy Name * ever, world without end.<br />
 <br />
Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us * this day without sin.<br />
O Lord, have mercy upon us, * have mercy upon us.<br />
O Lord, let thy mercy lighten upon us, * as our trust is in thee.<br />
O Lord, in thee have I trusted, * let me never be confounded.<br />
