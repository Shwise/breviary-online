<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">W</i>ho madest all and dost control,<br />
Lord, with thy touch divine, <br />
Cast out the slumbers of the soul, <br />
The rest that is not thine.<br />
 <br />
Look down, Eternal Holiness,<br />
And wash the sins away,<br />
Of those, who, rising to confess,<br />
Outstrip the lingering day.<br />
 <br />
Our hearts and hands by night, O Lord,<br />
We lift them in Our need; <br />
As holy Psalmists give the word, <br />
And holy Paul the deed.<br />
 <br />
Each sin to thee of years gone by, <br />
Each hidden stain lies bare; <br />
We shrink not from thine awful eye,<br />
But pray that thou wouldst spare.<br />
 <br />
Grant this, O Father, Only Son <br />
And Spirit, God of grace, <br />
To whom all worship shall be done<br />
In every time and place,<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">4</span> Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Let darkness, and the shadow of death cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.<br />
