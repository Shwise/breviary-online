 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">D</i>ay is breaking, dawn is bright:<br />
Hence, vain shadows of the night! <br />
Mists that dim our mortal sight,<br />
Christ is come! Depart!<br />
 <br />
Darkness routed lifts her wings<br />
As the radiance upwards springs:<br />
Through the world of wakened things<br />
Life and colour dart.<br />
 <br />
Thee, O Christ, alone we know:<br />
Singing even in our woe, <br />
With pure hearts to thee we go:<br />
On our senses shine!<br />
 <br />
In thy beams be purged away <br />
All that leads our thoughts astray! <br />
Through our spirits, King of day,<br />
Pour thy light divine!<br />
 <br />
Unto God the Father, Son, <br />
Holy Spirit, Three in One, <br />
One in Three, be glory done,<br />
Now and evermore.<br />
Amen.<br />
