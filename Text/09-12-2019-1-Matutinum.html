<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>he God whom earth, and sea, and sky<br />
Adore, and laud, and magnify,<br />
Who o'er their threefold fabric reigns,<br />
The Virgin's spotless womb contains.<br />
 <br />
The God, whose will by moon and sun<br />
And all things in due course is done,<br />
Is borne upon a maiden's breast,<br />
By fullest heavenly grace possest,<br />
 <br />
How blest that mother, in whose shrine<br />
The great artificer divine,<br />
Whose hand contains the earth and sky,<br />
Vouchsafed, as in his ark, to lie.<br />
 <br />
Blest, in the message Gabriel brought;<br />
Blest, by the work the Spirit wrought;<br />
From whom the great desire of earth<br />
Took human flesh and human birth.<br />
 <br />
All honour, laud, and glory be,<br />
O Jesu, Virgin-born to thee;<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To Father and to Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">61:4</span>  How long do you rush in upon a man? * you all kill, as if you were thrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.<br />
<span class="w">61:5</span>  But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst: * they blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.<br />
<span class="w">61:6</span>  But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: * for from him is my patience.<br />
<span class="w">61:7</span>  For he is my God and my saviour: * he is my helper, I shall not be moved.<br />

<span class="w">61:11</span>  Trust not in iniquity, and cover not robberies: * if riches abound, set not your heart upon them.<br />
<span class="w">61:12</span>  God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power belongeth to God, and mercy to thee, O Lord; * for thou wilt render to every man according to his works.<br />

<span class="w">1</span> Then the Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind, and said:<br />
<span class="w">2</span> Who is this that wrappeth up sentences in unskillful words?<br />
<span class="w">3</span> Gird up thy loins like a man I will ask thee, and answer thou me.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> Where wast thou when I laid up the foundations of the earth tell me if thou hast understanding.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?<br />
<span class="w">6</span> Upon what are its bases grounded? or who laid the corner stone thereof,<br />
<span class="w">7</span> When the morning stars praised me together, and all the sons of God made a joyful melody?<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> What shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?<br />
* The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away. As the Lord hath pleased, so hath it befallen. Blessed be the Name of the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away. As the Lord hath pleased, so hath it befallen. Blessed be the Name of the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>She whose feast-day we are keeping, Mary, blessed Maid of Maidens, be our Advocate with God. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Job 38:8-13</span><br />
<span class="w">8</span> Who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth as issuing out of the womb?<br />
<span class="w">9</span> When I made a cloud the garment thereof, and wrapped it in a mist as in swaddling bands?<br />
<span class="w">10</span> I set my bounds around it, and made it bars and doors.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> And I said: Hitherto thou shalt come, and shalt go no further, and here thou shalt break thy swelling waves.<br />
<span class="w">12</span> Didst thou since thy birth command the morning, and shew the dawning of the day its place?<br />
<span class="w">13</span> And didst thou hold the extremities of the earth shaking them, and hast thou shaken the ungodly out of it?<br />
<span class="ri">Job 38:14-20</span><br />
<span class="w">14</span> The seal shall be restored as clay, and shall stand as a garment.<br />
<span class="w">15</span> From the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the high arm shall be broken.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> Hast thou entered into the depths of the sea, and walked in the lowest parts of the deep?<br />
<span class="w">17</span> Have the gates of death been opened to thee, and hast thou seen the darksome doors?<br />
<span class="w">18</span> Hast thou considered the breadth of the earth? tell me, if thou knowest all things?<br />
<span class="w">19</span> Where is the way where light dwelleth, and where is the place of darkness?<br />
<span class="w">20</span> That thou mayst bring every thing to its own bounds, and understand the paths of the house thereof.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Why do ye argue against the words of truth? Do ye imagine words to reprove me and strive to confound one that is your friend?<br />
* Nevertheless, finish that ye have in mind.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Judge that which is just, and ye shall find no iniquity in my tongue.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Nevertheless, finish that ye have in mind.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
The honoured name of the Virgin Mary, which is said to mean Star of the Sea, is most fitting for the Virgin Mother. She may well be compared to a star; for, as a star beameth forth its rays without any diminution of its own lustre, so too the Virgin gave birth to a Son with no loss to her virginity. The departing rays do not lessen the star's brightness, nor Mary's Son her ínviolate maidenhood. She is, therefore, that noble star risen from Jacob and raised by nature above this great and wide sea. She shineth with merits, she enlighteneth with her example. Ye, all ye that are cast about upon sea of temporalities in storms and tempests more than ye walk on solid land, turn ye not your eyes away from the brightness of this star. Think of Mary, call on Mary, so that ye may experience for yourself how fittingly it was said, And the Virgin's name was Mary. - Pope Innocent XI ordered the Feast of this most holy name, which had already been honoured with a special rite in some parts of the Christian world, to be celebrated each year by the universal Church as a perpetual memorial of the great blessing of that signal victory won at Vienna in Austria over the cruel Turkish tyrant who had been grinding down the Christian people.<br />
