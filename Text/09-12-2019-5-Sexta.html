<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> God of truth, O Lord of might,<br />
Who orderest time and change aright,<br />
Who send’st the early morning ray,<br />
And light’st the glow of perfect day:<br />
 <br />
Extinguish thou each sinful fire,<br />
And banish every ill desire;<br />
And while thou keep’st the body whole,<br />
Shed forth thy peace upon the soul.<br />
 <br />
* Almighty Father, hear our cry,<br />
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">73:2</span>  Remember thy congregation, * which thou hast possessed from the beginning.<br />
<span class="w">73:2</span>  The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: * mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.<br />
<span class="w">73:3</span>  Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; * see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.<br />
<span class="w">73:4</span>  And they that hate thee have made their boasts, * in the midst of thy solemnity.<br />
<span class="w">73:5</span>  They have set up their ensigns for signs, * and they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top.<br />
<span class="w">73:6</span>  As with axes in a wood of trees, they have cut down at once the gates thereof, * with axe and hatchet they have brought it down.<br />
<span class="w">73:7</span>  They have set fire to thy sanctuary: * they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth.<br />
<span class="w">73:8</span>  They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: * Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land.<br />
<span class="w">73:9</span>  Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: * and he will know us no more.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 73(10-17)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">73:10</span>  How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: * is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever?<br />
<span class="w">73:11</span>  Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand * out of the midst of thy bosom for ever?<br />
<span class="w">73:12</span>  But God is our king before ages: * he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">73:13</span>  Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: * thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters.<br />
<span class="w">73:14</span>  Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: * thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.<br />
<span class="w">73:15</span>  Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: * thou hast dried up the Ethan rivers.<br />
<span class="w">73:16</span>  Thine is the day, and thine is the night: * thou hast made the morning light and the sun.<br />
<span class="w">73:17</span>  Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: * the summer and the spring were formed by thee.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 73(18-23)</span><em> [3]</em><br />

<span class="w">73:19</span>  Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: * and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor.<br />
<span class="w">73:20</span>  Have regard to thy covenant: * for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">73:21</span>  Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: * the poor and needy shall praise thy name.<br />
<span class="w">73:22</span>  Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: * remember thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day.<br />
<span class="w">73:23</span>  Forget not the voices of thy enemies: * the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth continually.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
