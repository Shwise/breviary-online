<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Phil 2:5-7</span><br />
<i class="a">F</i>or let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">A</i>broad the regal banners fly,<br />
Now shines the crossâ€™s mystery;<br />
Upon it Life did death endure, <br />
And yet by death did life procure.<br />
 <br />
Who, wounded with a direful spear,<br />
Did, purposely to wash us clear<br />
From stain of sin, pour out a flood<br />
Of precious water mixed with blood.<br />
 <br />
That which the prophet-king of old<br />
Hath in mysterious verse foretold, <br />
Is now accomplished, whilst we see<br />
God ruling nations from a tree.<br />
 <br />
O lovely and refulgent tree, <br />
Adorned with purpled majesty; <br />
Culled from a worthy stock, to bear<br />
Those limbs which sanctifiÃ¨d were.<br />
 <br />
Blest tree, whose happy branches bore<br />
The wealth that did the world restore;<br />
The beam that did that body weigh<br />
Which raised up hellâ€™s expected prey.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">The following verse is said on bended knee.</span><br />
 <br />
O Cross, our one reliance, hail!<br />
On this triumphant day avail<br />
To give fresh merit to the saint,<br />
And pardon to the penitent.<br />
 <br />
Blest Trinity, salvationâ€™s spring, <br />
May every soul thy praises sing; <br />
To those thou grantest conquest by<br />
The holy cross, rewards apply.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> This sign of the Cross shall be in heaven.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> When the Lord cometh to judgment.<br />

<span class="w">1:47</span> And my spirit hath rejoiced * in God my Saviour.<br />
<span class="w">1:48</span> Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; * for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.<br />
<span class="w">1:49</span> Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; * and holy is his name.<br />
<span class="w">1:50</span> And his mercy is from generation unto generations, * to them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">1:51</span> He hath shewed might in his arm: * he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.<br />
<span class="w">1:52</span> He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble.<br />
<span class="w">1:53</span> He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
<span class="w">1:54</span> He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy:<br />
<span class="w">1:55</span> As he spoke to our fathers, * to Abraham and to his seed for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
