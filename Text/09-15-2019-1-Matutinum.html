<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow, from the slumbers of the night arising, <br />
Chant we the holy psalmody of David,<br />
Hymns to our Master, with a voice concordant,<br />
Sweetly intoning.<br />
 <br />
So may our Monarch pitifully hear us,<br />
That we may merit with his saints to enter<br />
Mansions eternal, therewithal possessing<br />
Joy beatific.<br />
 <br />
This be our portion, God forever blessed,<br />
Father eternal, Son, and Holy Spirit,<br />
Whose is the glory, which through all creation<br />
Ever resoundeth.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">5</span> Moreover when all went to the golden calves which Jeroboam king of Israel had made, he alone fled the company of all,<br />
<span class="w">6</span> And went to Jerusalem to the temple of the Lord, and there adored the Lord God of Israel, offering faithfully all his firstfruits, and his tithes,<br />
<span class="w">7</span> So that in the third year he gave all his tithes to the proselytes, and strangers.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> These and such like things did he observe when but a boy according to the law of God.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> But when he was a man, he took to wife Anna of his own tribe, and had a son by her, whom he called after his own name,<br />
<span class="w">10</span> And from his infancy he taught him to fear God, and to abstain from all sin.<br />
<span class="ri">Tob 1:11-15</span><br />

<span class="w">12</span> (When all ate of the meats of the Gentiles) he kept his soul and never was defiled with their meats.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> And because he was mindful of the Lord with all his heart, God gave him favour in the sight of Salmanasar the king.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> And he gave him leave to go whithersoever he would, with liberty to do whatever he had a mind.<br />

At that time, Jesus said unto His disciples: No man can serve two masters. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo.<br />
<span class="ri">Bk. ii. on the Lord's Sermon on the Mount, ch. xiv.</span><br />
"No man can serve two masters," and this is further explained "for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other." These words we ought carefully to weigh, for the Lord showeth straightway who be the two masters whom we have choice of: "Ye cannot serve God and Mammon." Mammon is a term which the Hebrews are said to use for riches. It is also a Carthaginian word for the Punic for "gain" is "mammon."<br />
