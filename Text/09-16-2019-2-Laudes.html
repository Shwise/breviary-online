<span class="w">46:2</span>  O clap your hands, all ye nations: * shout unto God with the voice of joy,<br />
<span class="w">46:3</span>  For the Lord is high, terrible: * a great king over all the earth.<br />
<span class="w">46:4</span>  He hath subdued the people under us; * and the nations under our feet.<br />

<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i> glorious King of martyr hosts,<br />
Thou crown that each confessor boasts,<br />
Who leadest to celestial day<br />
Those who have cast earth's joys away:<br />
 <br />
Thine ear in mercy, Saviour, lend,<br />
While unto thee our prayers ascend;<br />
And as we count their triumphs won,<br />
Forgive the sins that we have done.<br />
 <br />
Martyrs in thee their triumphs gain,<br />
From thee confessors grace obtain;<br />
O'ercome in us the lust of sin,<br />
That we thy pardoning love may win.<br />
 <br />
To thee who, dead, again dost live,<br />
All glory, Lord, thy people give;<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To Father and to Paraclete.<br />
Amen. <br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The saints shall rejoice in glory:<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They shall be joyful in their beds.<br />
