 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">E</i>arth's mighty Maker, whose command<br />
Raised from the sea the solid land; <br />
And drove each billowy heap away,<br />
And bade the earth stand firm for aye:<br />
 <br />
That so, with flowers of golden hue,<br />
The seeds of each it might renew; <br />
And fruit-trees bearing fruit might yield,<br />
And pleasant pasture of the field:<br />
 <br />
Our spirit’s rankling wounds efface<br />
With dewy freshness of thy grace:<br />
That grief may cleanse each deed of ill,<br />
And o’er each lust may triumph still.<br />
 <br />
Let every soul thy law obey, <br />
And keep from every evil way; <br />
Rejoice each promised good to win,<br />
And flee from every mortal sin.<br />
 <br />
Hear thou our prayer, Almighty King!<br />
Hear thou our praises, while we sing,<br />
Adoring with the heavenly host, <br />
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!<br />
Amen.<br />
