<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> God of truth, O Lord of might,<br />
Who orderest time and change aright,<br />
Who send’st the early morning ray,<br />
And light’st the glow of perfect day:<br />
 <br />
Extinguish thou each sinful fire,<br />
And banish every ill desire;<br />
And while thou keep’st the body whole,<br />
Shed forth thy peace upon the soul.<br />
 <br />
* Almighty Father, hear our cry,<br />
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 118(81-96)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">118:81</span>  <span class="w">(Caph)</span> My soul hath fainted after thy salvation: * and in thy word I have very much hoped.<br />
<span class="w">118:82</span>  My eyes have failed for thy word, * saying: When wilt thou comfort me?<br />
<span class="w">118:83</span>  For I am become like a bottle in the frost: * I have not forgotten thy justifications.<br />
<span class="w">118:84</span>  How many are the days of thy servant: * when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?<br />
<span class="w">118:85</span>  The wicked have told me fables: * but not as thy law.<br />
<span class="w">118:86</span>  All thy statutes are truth: * they have persecuted me unjustly, do thou help me.<br />
<span class="w">118:87</span>  They had almost made an end of me upon earth: * but I have not forsaken thy commandments.<br />
<span class="w">118:88</span>  Quicken thou me according to thy mercy: * and I shall keep the testimonies of thy mouth.<br />
<span class="w">118:89</span>  <span class="w">(Lamed)</span> For ever, O Lord, * thy word standeth firm in heaven.<br />
<span class="w">118:90</span>  Thy truth unto all generations: * thou hast founded the earth, and it continueth.<br />
<span class="w">118:91</span>  By thy ordinance the day goeth on: * for all things serve thee.<br />
<span class="w">118:92</span>  Unless thy law had been my meditation, * I had then perhaps perished in my abjection.<br />
<span class="w">118:93</span>  Thy justifications I will never forget: * for by them thou hast given me life.<br />
<span class="w">118:94</span>  I am thine, save thou me: * for I have sought thy justifications.<br />
<span class="w">118:95</span>  The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: * but I have understood thy testimonies.<br />
<span class="w">118:96</span>  I have seen an end of all perfection: * thy commandment is exceeding broad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 118(97-112)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">118:97</span>  <span class="w">(Mem)</span> How have I loved thy law, O Lord! * it is my meditation all the day.<br />
<span class="w">118:98</span>  Through thy commandment, thou hast made me wiser than my enemies: * for it is ever with me.<br />
<span class="w">118:99</span>  I have understood more than all my teachers: * because thy testimonies are my meditation.<br />
<span class="w">118:100</span>  I have had understanding above ancients: * because I have sought thy commandments.<br />
<span class="w">118:101</span>  I have restrained my feet from every evil way: * that I may keep thy words.<br />
<span class="w">118:102</span>  I have not declined from thy judgments, * because thou hast set me a law.<br />
<span class="w">118:103</span>  How sweet are thy words to my palate! * more than honey to my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">118:104</span>  By thy commandments I have had understanding: * therefore have I hated every way of iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">118:105</span>  <span class="w">(Nun)</span> Thy word is a lamp to my feet, * and a light to my paths.<br />
<span class="w">118:106</span>  I have sworn and am determined * to keep the judgments of thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">118:107</span>  I have been humbled, O Lord, exceedingly: * quicken thou me according to thy word.<br />
<span class="w">118:108</span>  The free offerings of my mouth make acceptable, O Lord: * and teach me thy judgments.<br />
<span class="w">118:109</span>  My soul is continually in my hands: * and I have not forgotten thy law.<br />
<span class="w">118:110</span>  Sinners have laid a snare for me: * but I have not erred from thy precepts.<br />
<span class="w">118:111</span>  I have purchased thy testimonies for an inheritance for ever: * because they are the joy of my heart.<br />
<span class="w">118:112</span>  I have inclined my heart to do thy justifications for ever, * for the reward.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 118(113-128)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">118:113</span>  <span class="w">(Samech)</span> I have hated the unjust: * and I have loved thy law.<br />

<span class="w">118:115</span>  Depart from me, ye malignant: * and I will search the commandments of my God.<br />
<span class="w">118:116</span>  Uphold me according to thy word, and I shall live: * and let me not be confounded in my expectation.<br />
<span class="w">118:117</span>  Help me, and I shall be saved: * and I will meditate always on thy justifications.<br />
<span class="w">118:118</span>  Thou hast despised all them that fall off from thy judgments; * for their thought is unjust.<br />
<span class="w">118:119</span>  I have accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators: * therefore have I loved thy testimonies.<br />
<span class="w">118:120</span>  Pierce thou my flesh with thy fear: * for I am afraid of thy judgments.<br />
<span class="w">118:121</span>  <span class="w">(Ain)</span> I have done judgment and justice: * give me not up to them that slander me.<br />
<span class="w">118:122</span>  Uphold thy servant unto good: * let not the proud calumniate me.<br />
<span class="w">118:123</span>  My eyes have fainted after thy salvation: * and for the word of thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">118:124</span>  Deal with thy servant according to thy mercy: * and teach me thy justifications.<br />
<span class="w">118:125</span>  I am thy servant: * give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies.<br />
<span class="w">118:126</span>  It is time, O Lord, to do: * they have dissipated thy law.<br />
<span class="w">118:127</span>  Therefore have I loved thy commandments * above gold and the topaz.<br />
<span class="w">118:128</span>  Therefore was I directed to all thy commandments: * I have hated all wicked ways.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
