<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />
