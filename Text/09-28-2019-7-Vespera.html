<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Rev 1:1-2</span><br />
<i class="a">G</i>od gave unto Jesus Christ to show unto His servants the things which must shortly come to pass and He sent and signified it by His Angel unto His servant John, who bare witness of the Word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, of all the things which he saw.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
O Jesu Life, spring of the soul!<br />
The Father's power and glory bright!<br />
thee with the Angels we extol;<br />
From thee they draw their life and light.<br />
 <br />
thy thousand thousand hosts are spread<br />
Embattled o'er the azure sky;<br />
But Michael bears thy standard dread,<br />
And lifts the mighty Cross on high.<br />
 <br />
He in that Sign the rebel power.<br />
Did with their Dragon Prince expel;<br />
And hurled them from the heaven.' high towers,<br />
Down like a thunderbolt to hell.<br />
 <br />
Grant us, with Michael, still, O Lord,<br />
Against the prince of pride to fight;<br />
So may a crown be our reward,<br />
Before the Lamb's pure throne of light.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father, with the Son<br />
And Holy Paraclete, with thee,<br />
As evermore hath been before,<br />
Be glory through eternity.<br />
Amen.<br />
