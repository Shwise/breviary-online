<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> strength and stay upholding all creation,<br />
Who ever dost thyself unmoved abide,<br />
Yet day by day the light in due gradation<br />
From hour to hour through all its changes guide:<br />
 <br />
Grant to life’s day a calm unclouded ending,<br />
An eve untouched by shadows of decay,<br />
The brightness of a holy death-bed blending<br />
With dawning glories of th’ eternal day.<br />
 <br />
* Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,<br />
And thou, O Christ, the co-eternal Word,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living<br />
Now and to endless ages art adored.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">118:130</span>  The declaration of thy words giveth light: * and giveth understanding to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">118:131</span>  I opened my mouth, and panted: * because I longed for thy commandments.<br />
<span class="w">118:132</span>  Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me, * according to the judgment of them that love thy name.<br />
<span class="w">118:133</span>  Direct my steps according to thy word: * and let no iniquity have dominion over me.<br />
<span class="w">118:134</span>  Redeem me from the calumnies of men: * that I may keep thy commandments.<br />
<span class="w">118:135</span>  Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: * and teach me thy justifications.<br />
<span class="w">118:136</span>  My eyes have sent forth springs of water: * because they have not kept thy law.<br />
<span class="w">118:137</span>  <span class="w">(Sade)</span> Thou art just, O Lord: * and thy judgment is right.<br />
<span class="w">118:138</span>  Thou hast commanded justice thy testimonies: * and thy truth exceedingly.<br />
<span class="w">118:139</span>  My zeal hath made me pine away: * because my enemies forgot thy words.<br />

<span class="w">118:156</span>  Many, O Lord, are thy mercies: * quicken me according to thy judgment.<br />
<span class="w">118:157</span>  Many are they that persecute me, and afflict me; * but I have not declined from thy testimonies.<br />
