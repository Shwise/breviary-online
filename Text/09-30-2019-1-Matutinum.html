<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i>ur limbs refreshed with slumber now, <br />
And sloth cast off, in prayer we bow;<br />
And while we sing thy praises dear,<br />
O Father, be thou present here.<br />
 <br />
To thee our earliest morning song,<br />
To thee our hearts full powers belong;<br />
And thou, O Holy One, prevent <br />
Each following action and intent.<br />
 <br />
As shades at morning flee away,<br />
And night before the star of day;<br />
So each transgression of the night<br />
Be purged by thee, celestial Light!<br />
 <br />
Cut off, we pray thee, each offense,<br />
And every lust of thought and sense:<br />
That by their lips who thee adore <br />
Thou mayst be praised forevermore.<br />
 <br />
Grant this, O Father ever One<br />
With Christ, thy sole-begotten Son,<br />
And Holy Ghost, whom all adore,<br />
Reigning and blest forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven * upon the children of men.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 13</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  The fool hath said in his heart: * there is no God.<br />
<span class="w">13:1</span>  They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: * there is none that doth good, no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:2</span>  The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see if there be any that understand and seek God.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: * there is none that doth good: no not one.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: * the poison of asps is under their lips.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; * their feet are swift to shed blood.<br />
<span class="w">13:3</span>  Destruction and unhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: * there is no fear of God before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">13:4</span>  Shall not all they know that work iniquity, * who devour my people as they eat bread?<br />
<span class="w">13:5</span>  They have not called upon the Lord: * there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.<br />
<span class="w">13:6</span>  For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man; * but the Lord is his hope.<br />
<span class="w">13:7</span>  Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? * when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> He who worketh justice * may rest on thy holy mountain, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 14</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">14:1</span>  Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest in thy holy hill?<br />
<span class="w">14:2</span>  He that walketh without blemish, * and worketh justice:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  He that speaketh truth in his heart, * who hath not used deceit in his tongue:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: * nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.<br />
<span class="w">14:4</span>  In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: * but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not; * He that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that doth these things, * shall not be moved for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> He who worketh justice may rest on thy holy mountain, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, incline * thy ear to me, and hear my voice, my Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 16</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">16:1</span>  Hear, O Lord, my justice: * attend to my supplication.<br />
<span class="w">16:1</span>  Give ear unto my prayer, * which proceedeth not from deceitful lips.<br />
<span class="w">16:2</span>  Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: * let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable.<br />
<span class="w">16:3</span>  Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, * thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.<br />
<span class="w">16:4</span>  That my mouth may not speak the works of men: * for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.<br />
<span class="w">16:5</span>  Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: * that my footsteps be not moved.<br />
<span class="w">16:6</span>  I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: * O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.<br />
<span class="w">16:7</span>  Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; * thou who savest them that trust in thee.<br />
<span class="w">16:8</span>  From them that resist thy right hand keep me, * as the apple of thy eye.<br />
<span class="w">16:9</span>  Protect me under the shadow of thy wings. * from the face of the wicked who have afflicted me.<br />
<span class="w">16:10</span>  My enemies have surrounded my soul: They have shut up their fat: * their mouth hath spoken proudly.<br />
<span class="w">16:11</span>  They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: * they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.<br />
<span class="w">16:12</span>  They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; * and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.<br />
<span class="w">16:13</span>  Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; * deliver my soul from the wicked one; thy sword from the enemies of thy hand.<br />
<span class="w">16:14</span>  O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: * their belly is filled from thy hidden stores.<br />
<span class="w">16:14</span>  They are full of children: * and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.<br />
<span class="w">16:15</span>  But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: * I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, incline thy ear to me, and hear my voice, my Lord.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 17(2-16)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">17:2</span>  I will love thee, O Lord, my strength: * The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer.<br />
<span class="w">17:3</span>  My God is my helper, * and in him will I put my trust.<br />
<span class="w">17:3</span>  My protector, and the horn of my salvation, * and my support.<br />
<span class="w">17:4</span>  Praising, I will call upon the Lord: * and I shall be saved from my enemies.<br />
<span class="w">17:5</span>  The sorrows of death surrounded me: * and the torrents of iniquity troubled me.<br />
<span class="w">17:6</span>  The sorrows of hell encompassed me: * and the snares of death prevented me.<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  In my affliction I called upon the Lord, * and I cried to my God:<br />
<span class="w">17:7</span>  And he heard my voice from his holy temple: * and my cry before him came into his ears.<br />
<span class="w">17:8</span>  The earth shook and trembled: * the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them.<br />
<span class="w">17:9</span>  There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his face: * coals were kindled by it.<br />
<span class="w">17:10</span>  He bowed the heavens, and came down, * and darkness was under his feet.<br />
<span class="w">17:11</span>  And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; * he flew upon the wings of the winds.<br />
<span class="w">17:12</span>  And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him: * dark waters in the clouds of the air.<br />
<span class="w">17:13</span>  At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, * hail and coals of fire.<br />
<span class="w">17:14</span>  And the Lord thundered from heaven, * and the Highest gave his voice: * hail and coals of fire.<br />
<span class="w">17:15</span>  And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: * he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  Then the fountains of waters appeared, * and the foundations of the world were discovered:<br />
<span class="w">17:16</span>  At thy rebuke, O Lord, * at the blast of the spirit of thy wrath.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord will reward me * according to my justice.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 17(17-35)</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">17:17</span>  He sent from on high, and took me: * and received me out of many waters.<br />
<span class="w">17:18</span>  He delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them that hated me: * for they were too strong for me.<br />
<span class="w">17:19</span>  They prevented me in the day of my affliction: * and the Lord became my protector.<br />
<span class="w">17:20</span>  And he brought me forth into a large place: * he saved me, because he was well pleased with me.<br />
<span class="w">17:21</span>  And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; * and will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:<br />
<span class="w">17:22</span>  Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; * and have not done wickedly against my God.<br />
<span class="w">17:23</span>  For all his judgments are in my sight: * and his justices I have not put away from me.<br />
<span class="w">17:24</span>  And I shall be spotless with him: * and shall keep myself from my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">17:25</span>  And the Lord will reward me according to my justice: * and according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.<br />
<span class="w">17:26</span>  With the holy thou wilt be holy; * and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent:<br />
<span class="w">17:27</span>  And with the elect thou wilt be elect: * and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted.<br />
<span class="w">17:28</span>  For thou wilt save the humble people; * but wilt bring down the eyes of the proud.<br />

Lesson from the book of Esther<br />
<span class="ri">Esth 2:5-7</span><br />
<span class="w">5</span> There was a man in the city of Susan, a Jew, named Mardochai, the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the race of Jemini,<br />
<span class="w">6</span> Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away Jechonias king of Juda,<br />
<span class="w">7</span> And he had brought up his brother's daughter Edissa, who by another name was called Esther: now she had lost both her parents: and was exceeding fair and beautiful. And her father and mother being dead, Mardochai adopted her for his daughter.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O my Lord, the King Almighty All things are in thy power, and there is no man that can gainsay thy will;<br />
* Deliver us for thy Name's sake.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Hear our prayer, and turn our sorrow into joy.<br />

<span class="ri">Esth 2:8-11</span><br />
<span class="w">8</span> And when the king's ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch to hasten the women's ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the king's house, and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai had charged her to say nothing at all of that:<br />
<span class="w">11</span> And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the chosen virgins werre kept, having a care for Esther's welfare, and desiring to know what would befall her.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<span class="ri">Esth 2:15-17</span><br />
<span class="w">15</span> And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not women's ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind, he gave her to adorn her. For she was exceeding fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable in the eyes of all.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.<br />
<span class="w">17</span> And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour and kindness before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vasthi.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I have had no hope in any other but in thee, O God of Israel, Who art angry, and wilt again show mercy,<br />
* Thou that forgivest all the sins of men when they are in affliction.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> O Lord God, Maker of heaven and earth, look upon our low estate;<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thou that forgivest all the sins of men when they are in affliction.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
