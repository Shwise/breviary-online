<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">A</i>ngel-guardians of men, spirits and powers we sing,<br />
Whom our Father hath sent, aids to our weakly frame,<br />
Heavenly friends and guides, help from on high to bring,<br />
Lest we fail through the foeman's wile.<br />
 <br />
He, the spoiler of souls, angel-traitor of old,<br />
Cast in merited wrath out of his honoured place,<br />
Burns with envy and hate, seeking their souls to gain<br />
Whom God's mercy invites to heaven.<br />
 <br />
Therefore come to our help, watchful ward of our lives:<br />
Turn aside from the land God to thy care confides<br />
Sickness and woe of soul, yea, and what else of ill<br />
Peace of heart to its folk denies.<br />
 <br />
Now to the Holy Three praise evermore resound:<br />
Under whose hand divine resteth the triple world<br />
Governed in wondrous wise: glory be theirs and might<br />
While the ages unending run.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">8:2</span>  For thy magnificence is elevated * above the heavens.<br />
<span class="w">8:3</span>  Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise, because of thy enemies, * that thou mayst destroy the enemy and the avenger.<br />
<span class="w">8:4</span>  For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: * the moon and the stars which thou hast founded.<br />
<span class="w">8:5</span>  What is man that thou art mindful of him? * or the son of man that thou visitest him?<br />
<span class="w">8:6</span>  Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour: * and hast set him over the works of thy hands.<br />
<span class="w">8:8</span>  Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, * all sheep and oxen: moreover the beasts also of the fields.<br />
<span class="w">8:9</span>  The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, * that pass through the paths of the sea.<br />

<span class="w">10:2</span>  In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: * Get thee away from hence to the mountain, like a sparrow?<br />
<span class="w">10:3</span>  For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow: they have prepared their arrows in the quiver, * to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.<br />
<span class="w">10:4</span>  For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: * but what has the just man done?<br />
<span class="w">10:5</span>  The Lord is in his holy temple, * the Lordâ€™s throne is in heaven.<br />
<span class="w">10:5</span>  His eyes look on the poor man: * his eyelids examine the sons of men.<br />
<span class="w">10:6</span>  The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: * but he that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul.<br />
<span class="w">10:7</span>  He shall rain snares upon sinners: * fire and brimstone, and storms of winds, shall be the portion of their cup.<br />
<span class="w">10:8</span>  For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: * his countenance hath beheld righteousness.<br />

<span class="w">14:3</span>  Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: * nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.<br />
<span class="w">14:4</span>  In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: * but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not; * He that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that doth these things, * shall not be moved for ever.<br />

<span class="w">18:4</span>  There are no speeches nor languages, * where their voices are not heard.<br />
<span class="w">18:5</span>  Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: * and their words unto the ends of the world.<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: * and he, as a bridegroom coming out of his bride chamber,<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,<br />
<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />

<span class="ri">Exod 23:20-23</span><br />
<span class="w">20</span> Behold I will send my angel, who shall go before thee, and keep thee in thy journey, and bring thee into the place that I have prepared.<br />
<span class="w">21</span> Take notice of him, and hear his voice, and do not think him one to be contemned: for he will not forgive when thou hast sinned, and my name is in him.<br />
<span class="w">22</span> But if thou wilt hear his voice, and do all that I speak, I will be an enemy to thy enemies, and will afflict them that afflict thee.<br />
<span class="w">23</span> And my angel shall go before thee, and shall bring thee in unto the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, whom I will destroy.<br />

From Zacharias the Prophet.<br />
<span class="ri">Zech 1:7-11</span><br />
<span class="w">7</span> In the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is called Sabath, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying:<br />
<span class="w">8</span> I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees, that were in the bottom: and behind him were horses, red, speckled, and white.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> And I said: What are these, my Lord? and the angel that spoke in me, said to me: I will shew thee what these are:<br />
<span class="w">10</span> And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered, and said: These are they, whom the Lord hath sent to walk through the earth.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> And they answered the angel of the Lord, that stood among the myrtle trees, and said: We have walked through the earth, and behold all the earth is inhabited, and is at rest.<br />
<span class="ri">Zech 2:1-5</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold a man, with a measuring line in his hand.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> And I said: Whither goest thou? and he said to me: To measure Jerusalem, and to see how great is the breadth thereof, and how great the length thereof.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And behold the angel that spoke in me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And he said to him: Run, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls, by reason of the multitude of men, and of the beasts in the midst thereof.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> And I will be to it, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about: and I will be in glory in the midst thereof.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> When ye see the Gentiles, be not afraid of them, but in your hearts worship and fear the Lord;<br />
* For His Angel is with you.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> An Angel stood at the Altar of the Temple, having a golden censer in his hand.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For His Angel is with you.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For His Angel is with you.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />

From the Sermons of St. Bernard, Abbot <span class="w">of Clairvaux.</span><br />
<span class="ri">On Ps. xc</span><br />
He hath given His Angels charge over thee. A wonderful graciousness, and a wonderful outpouring of love. For who hath given charge? And what charge? Unto whom? And over whom? Let us carefully consider, my brethren, let us carefully hold in mind this great charge. For who hath given this charge? To Whom belong the Angels? Whose commandments do they obey, and Whose will do they do? He hath given His Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways, and that not carelessly, for they shall bear thee up in their hands. The Highest Majesty, therefore, hath given charge unto Angels, even His Angels. Unto these beings so excellently exalted, so blessed, so near to Himself, even as His own household, unto these hath He given charge over thee. Who art thou? What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that Thou visitest him? <span class="w">Ps. viii. 5.</span> Even as though man were not rottenness, and the son of man, a worm. <span class="w">Job. xxv. 6.</span> But what charge hath He given them over thee? To keep thee in all thy ways.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
