<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> strength and stay upholding all creation,<br />
Who ever dost thyself unmoved abide,<br />
Yet day by day the light in due gradation<br />
From hour to hour through all its changes guide:<br />
 <br />
Grant to life’s day a calm unclouded ending,<br />
An eve untouched by shadows of decay,<br />
The brightness of a holy death-bed blending<br />
With dawning glories of th’ eternal day.<br />
 <br />
* Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,<br />
And thou, O Christ, the co-eternal Word,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living<br />
Now and to endless ages art adored.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Rejoice ye  just, * and glory, all ye right of heart.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 31</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">31:1</span>  Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven * and whose sins are covered.<br />
<span class="w">31:2</span>  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin, * and in whose spirit there is no guile.<br />
<span class="w">31:3</span>  Because I was silent my bones grew old; * whilst I cried out all the day long.<br />
<span class="w">31:4</span>  For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: * I am turned in my anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.<br />
<span class="w">31:5</span>  I have acknowledged my sin to thee, * and my injustice I have not concealed.<br />
<span class="w">31:5</span>  I said I will confess against myself my injustice to the Lord: * and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.<br />
<span class="w">31:6</span>  For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee * in a seasonable time.<br />
<span class="w">31:6</span>  And yet in a flood of many waters, * they shall not come nigh unto him.<br />
<span class="w">31:7</span>  Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me: * my joy, deliver me from them that surround me.<br />
<span class="w">31:8</span>  I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this way, in which thou shalt go: * I will fix my eyes upon thee.<br />
<span class="w">31:9</span>  Do not become like the horse and the mule, * who have no understanding.<br />
<span class="w">31:9</span>  With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, * who come not near unto thee.<br />
<span class="w">31:10</span>  Many are the scourges of the sinner, * but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">31:11</span>  Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, * and glory, all ye right of heart.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 32(1-11)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">32:1</span>  Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just: * praise becometh the upright.<br />
<span class="w">32:2</span>  Give praise to the Lord on the harp; * sing to him with the psaltery, the instrument of ten strings.<br />
<span class="w">32:3</span>  Sing to him a new canticle, * sing well unto him with a loud noise.<br />
<span class="w">32:4</span>  For the word of the Lord is right, * and all his works are done with faithfulness.<br />
<span class="w">32:5</span>  He loveth mercy and judgment; * the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">32:6</span>  By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; * and all the power of them by the spirit of his mouth:<br />
<span class="w">32:7</span>  Gathering together the waters of the sea, as in a vessel; * laying up the depths in storehouses.<br />
<span class="w">32:8</span>  Let all the earth fear the Lord, * and let all the inhabitants of the world be in awe of him.<br />
<span class="w">32:9</span>  For he spoke and they were made: * he commanded and they were created.<br />
<span class="w">32:10</span>  The Lord bringeth to nought the counsels of nations; * and he rejecteth the devices of people, and casteth away the counsels of princes.<br />
<span class="w">32:11</span>  But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever: * the thoughts of his heart to all generations.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 32(12-22)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">32:12</span>  Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord: * the people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">32:13</span>  The Lord hath looked from heaven: * he hath beheld all the sons of men.<br />
<span class="w">32:14</span>  From his habitation which he hath prepared, * he hath looked upon all that dwell on the earth.<br />
<span class="w">32:15</span>  He who hath made the hearts of every one of them: * who understandeth all their works.<br />
<span class="w">32:16</span>  The king is not saved by a great army: * nor shall the giant be saved by his own great strength.<br />
<span class="w">32:17</span>  Vain is the horse for safety: * neither shall he be saved by the abundance of his strength.<br />
<span class="w">32:18</span>  Behold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him: * and on them that hope in his mercy.<br />
<span class="w">32:19</span>  To deliver their souls from death; * and feed them in famine.<br />
<span class="w">32:20</span>  Our soul waiteth for the Lord: * for he is our helper and protector.<br />
<span class="w">32:21</span>  For in him our heart shall rejoice: * and in his holy name we have trusted.<br />
<span class="w">32:22</span>  Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, * as we have hoped in thee.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Rejoice ye  just, and glory, all ye right of heart.<br />
