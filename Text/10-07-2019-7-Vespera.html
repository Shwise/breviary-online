<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">T</i>he gladness of thy motherhood,<br />
The anguish of thy suffering,<br />
The glory now that crowns thy brow,<br />
O Virgin-Mother, we would sing.<br />
 <br />
Hail, blessed Mother, full of joy<br />
In thy consent, thy visit too;<br />
Joy in the birth of Christ on earth,<br />
Joy in him lost and found anew.<br />
 <br />
Hail, sorrowing in his agony—<br />
The blows, the thorns that pierced his brow;<br />
The heavy wood, the shameful rood—<br />
Yea! Queen and chief of martyrs thou.<br />
 <br />
Hail, in the triumph of thy Son,<br />
The quickening flames of Pentecost;<br />
Shining a Queen in light serene,<br />
When all the world is tempest-tost.<br />
 <br />
O come, ye nations, roses bring,<br />
Culled from these mysteries divine,<br />
And for the Mother of your King<br />
With loving hands your chaplets twine.<br />
 <br />
We lay our homage at thy feet,<br />
Lord Jesus, thou the Virgin's Son,<br />
With Father and with Paraclete,<br />
Reigning while endless ages run.<br />
Amen.<br />
