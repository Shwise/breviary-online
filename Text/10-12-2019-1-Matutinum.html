<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of the season}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>he God whom earth, and sea, and sky<br />
Adore, and laud, and magnify,<br />
Who o'er their threefold fabric reigns,<br />
The Virgin's spotless womb contains.<br />
 <br />
The God, whose will by moon and sun<br />
And all things in due course is done,<br />
Is borne upon a maiden's breast,<br />
By fullest heavenly grace possest,<br />
 <br />
How blest that mother, in whose shrine<br />
The great artificer divine,<br />
Whose hand contains the earth and sky,<br />
Vouchsafed, as in his ark, to lie.<br />
 <br />
Blest, in the message Gabriel brought;<br />
Blest, by the work the Spirit wrought;<br />
From whom the great desire of earth<br />
Took human flesh and human birth.<br />
 <br />
All honour, laud, and glory be,<br />
O Jesu, Virgin-born to thee;<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To Father and to Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

Lesson from the first book of Machabees<br />
<span class="ri">1 Mac 3:42-45</span><br />
<span class="w">42</span> And Judas and his brethren saw that evils were multiplied, and that the armies approached to their borders: and they knew the orders the king had given to destroy the people and utterly abolish them.<br />
<span class="w">43</span> And they said every man to his neighbour: Let us raise up the low condition of our people, and let us fight for our people, and our sanctuary.<br />
<span class="w">44</span> And the assembly was gathered that they might be ready for battle: and that they might pray, and ask mercy and compassion.<br />
<span class="w">45</span> Now Jerusalem was not inhabited, but was like a desert: there was none of her children that went in or out: and the sanctuary was trodden down: and the children of strangers were in the castle, there was the habitation of the Gentiles: and joy was taken away from Jacob, and the pipe and harp ceased there.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The sun shone upon the shields of gold, and the mountains glistered therewith;<br />
* And the army of the heathens was spread abroad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For the army was very great and mighty then Judas and his host drew near and entered into battle.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And the army of the heathens was spread abroad.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Lord, please bless me.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Virgin of virgins, intercede for us to the Lord. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">1 Mac 3:46-53</span><br />
<span class="w">46</span> And they assembled together, and came to Maspha over against Jerusalem: for in Maspha was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel.<br />
<span class="w">47</span> And they fasted that day, and put on haircloth, and put ashes upon their heads: and they rent their garments:<br />
<span class="w">48</span> And they laid open the books of the law, in which the Gentiles searched for the likeness of their idols:<br />
<span class="w">49</span> And they brought the priestly ornaments, and the firstfruits and tithes, and stirred up the Nazarites that had fulfilled their days:<br />
<span class="w">50</span> And they cried with a loud voice toward heaven, saying: What shall we do with these, and whither shall we carry them?<br />
<span class="w">51</span> For thy holies are trodden down, and are profaned, and thy priests are in mourning, and are brought low.<br />
<span class="w">52</span> And behold the nations are come together against us to destroy us: thou knowest what they intend against us.<br />
<span class="w">53</span> How shall we be able to stand before their face, unless thou, O God, help us?<br />
<span class="ri">1 Mac 3:54-60</span><br />
<span class="w">54</span> Then they sounded with trumpets, and cried out with a loud voice.<br />
<span class="w">55</span> And after this Judas appointed captains over the people, over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.<br />
<span class="w">56</span> And he said to them that were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, that they should return every man to his house, according to the law.<br />
<span class="w">57</span> So they removed the camp, and pitched on the south side of Emmaus.<br />
<span class="w">58</span> And Judas said: Gird yourselves, and be valiant men, and be ready against the morning, that you may fight with these nations that are assembled against us to destroy us and our sanctuary.<br />
<span class="w">59</span> For it is better for us to die in battle, than to see the evils of our nation, and of the holies:<br />
<span class="w">60</span> Nevertheless as it shall be the will of God in heaven so be it done.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They praised the Lord with psalms and thanksgiving<br />
* Who had done so great things in Israel, and given them the victory the Lord Almighty.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> They decked the fore-front of the Temple with crowns of gold, and dedicated the Altar unto the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Who had done so great things for Israel, and given them the victory the Lord Almighty.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />

A sermon of St. Bernard, Abbot<br />
<span class="ri">Sermon of ch. 12 of the Apocalypse, in the first half</span><br />
My brothers, let us cast ourselves at Mary's blessed feet with the most devout supplication. Let us embrace them, let us hold fast to her, and not let go until she blesses us; for she has great power. Like the fleece between the dew and the threshing floor, like the woman between the sun and the moon, so Mary stands between Christ and the Church. But perhaps you wonder, not so much at the fleece covered with dew, but at the woman clothed with the sun. Any relationship between the sun and the woman would be striking enough, but this proximity is indeed something to be marveled at. How can so fragile a nature subsist in that excessive heat? You have a right to wonder, saintly Moses; it is only natural that in your curiosity you should want to look more closely. But "remove the sandals from your feet", put aside the covering of fleshly thoughts, if you wish to draw near.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
