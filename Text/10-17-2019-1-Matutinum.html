<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>on of a virgin, maker of thy mother,<br />
Thou, rod and blossom from a stem unstain√®d,<br />
Now while a virgin fair of fame we honour,<br />
Hear our devotion!<br />
 <br />
Fountain of mercy, hear the prayers she offers;<br />
Purge our offences, pardon our transgressions,<br />
So that hereafter we to thee may render<br />
Praise with thanksgiving.<br />
 <br />
Thou, the All-Father, thou, the One-Begotten,<br />
Thou, Holy Spirit, Three in One co-equal,<br />
Glory be henceforth thine through all the ages,<br />
World without ending.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">61:3</span>  For he is my God and my saviour: * he is my protector, I shall be moved no more.<br />
<span class="w">61:4</span>  How long do you rush in upon a man? * you all kill, as if you were thrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.<br />
<span class="w">61:5</span>  But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst: * they blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.<br />
<span class="w">61:6</span>  But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: * for from him is my patience.<br />
<span class="w">61:7</span>  For he is my God and my saviour: * he is my helper, I shall not be moved.<br />

<span class="w">61:9</span>  Trust in him, all ye congregation of people: pour out your hearts before him. * God is our helper for ever.<br />
<span class="w">61:10</span>  But vain are the sons of men, the sons of men are liars in the balances: * that by vanity they may together deceive.<br />
<span class="w">61:11</span>  Trust not in iniquity, and cover not robberies: * if riches abound, set not your heart upon them.<br />
<span class="w">61:12</span>  God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power belongeth to God, and mercy to thee, O Lord; * for thou wilt render to every man according to his works.<br />

<span class="ri">1 Mac 6:1-6</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> Now king Antiochus was going through the higher countries, and he heard that the city of Elymais in Persia was greatly renowned, and abounding in silver and gold.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> And that there was in it a temple, exceeding rich: and coverings of gold, and breastplates, and shields which king Alexander, son of Philip the Macedonian that reigned first in Greece, had left there.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> Lo, he came, and sought to take the city and to pillage it: But he was not able, because the design was known to them that were in the city.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And they rose up against him in battle, and he fled away from thence, and departed with great sadness, and returned towards Babylonia.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> And whilst he was in Persia, there came one that told him, how the armies that were in the land of Juda were put to flight:<br />
<span class="w">6</span> And that Lysias went with a very great power, and was put to flight before the face of the Jews,<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Lord open your hearts in His law and commandments, and send peace in your days.<br />
* May He grant you salvation and redeem you out of all evil.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The Lord hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and never forsake you in the time of trouble.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> May He grant you salvation and redeem you out of all evil.<br />

<span class="ri">1 Mac 6:6-9</span><br />
<span class="w">6</span> And that thy were grown strong by the armour, and power, and store of spoils, which they had gotten out of the camps which they had destroyed:<br />
<span class="w">7</span> And that they had thrown down the abomination which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls as before, and Bethsura also his city.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> And it came to pass when the king heard these words, that he was struck with fear, and exceedingly moved: and he laid himself down upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not fallen out to him as he imagined.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> And he remained there many days: for great grief came more and more and more upon him, and he made account that he should die.<br />
<span class="ri">1 Mac 6:10-13</span><br />
<span class="w">10</span> And he called for all his friends, and said to them: Sleep is gone from my eyes, and I am fallen away, and my heart is cast down for anxiety.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> And I said in my heart: Into how much tribulation am I come, and into what floods of sorrow, wherein now I am: I that was pleasant and beloved in my power!<br />
<span class="w">12</span> But now I remember the evils that I have done in Jerusalem, from whence also I took away all the spoils of gold, and of silver that were in it, and I sent to destroy the inhabitants of Juda without cause.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> I know therefore that for this cause these evils have found me: and behold I perish with great grief in a strange land.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Our enemies are gathered together, and make their boast of their own strength. O Lord, break their power, and scatter them<br />
* That they may know that there is none other that fighteth for us, but only Thou, O our God!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Scatter them in thy strength, and destroy them, O Lord our Shield.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> That they may know that there is none other that fighteth for us, but only Thou, O our God!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
Margaret Mary Alacoque was born of good parents in a village of the diocese of Autun, and even from her early years gave signs of her future sanctity. Burning with love for the Virgin Mother of God and for the august Sacrament of the Eucharist, as young woman she vowed her virginity to God. When she had entered the Order of the Visitation, she began to shine at once with the brightness of the religious life. She was adorned by God with the highest gifts of prayer, with other gifts of grace and with frequent visions. The most celebrated was this: when she was praying before the Eucharist, Jesus shewed himself to her with his Heart burning with flames and encircled with thorns, in his open breast, and he commanded that, in return for such love and to expiate the injuries of ungrateful men, she was to strive to institute the public cult of this Heart, promising in return great treasures of heavenly grace. She was famous for her religious perfection and, by the contemplation of divine things, each day she became more united with her heavenly Bridegroom. To him she went in the forty-third year of her age, in 1690. Renowned for miracles, she was numbered among the Saints by Benedict XV. Pope Pius XI extended her Office to the universal Church.<br />
