<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> strength and stay upholding all creation,<br />
Who ever dost thyself unmoved abide,<br />
Yet day by day the light in due gradation<br />
From hour to hour through all its changes guide:<br />
 <br />
Grant to life’s day a calm unclouded ending,<br />
An eve untouched by shadows of decay,<br />
The brightness of a holy death-bed blending<br />
With dawning glories of th’ eternal day.<br />
 <br />
* Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,<br />
And thou, O Christ, the co-eternal Word,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living<br />
Now and to endless ages art adored.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">74:6</span>  Lift not up your horn on high: * speak not iniquity against God.<br />
<span class="w">74:7</span>  For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert hills: * for God is the judge.<br />
<span class="w">74:8</span>  One he putteth down, and another he lifteth up: * for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture.<br />
