<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>h' eternal gifts of Christ the King,<br />
The Apostles' glory, let us sing;<br />
And all with hearts of gladness raise<br />
Due hymns of thankful love and praise.<br />
 <br />
For they the Church's princes are,<br />
Triumphant leaders in the war,<br />
The heavenly King's own warrior band,<br />
True lights to lighten every land.<br />
 <br />
Theirs was the steadfast faith of saints,<br />
The hope that never yields nor faints,<br />
The love of Christ in perfect glow,<br />
That lay the prince of this world low.<br />
 <br />
In them the Father's glory shone,<br />
In them the Spirit's will was done,<br />
The Son himself exults in them;<br />
Joy fills the new Jerusalem.<br />
 <br />
* Praise to the Father, with the Son,<br />
And Holy Spirit, Three in One;<br />
As ever was in ages past,<br />
And so shall be while ages last.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 18</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">18:2</span>  The heavens shew forth the glory of God, * and the firmament declareth the work of his hands.<br />
<span class="w">18:3</span>  Day to day uttereth speech, * and night to night sheweth knowledge.<br />
<span class="w">18:4</span>  There are no speeches nor languages, * where their voices are not heard.<br />

<span class="w">18:6</span>  Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,<br />
<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">18:9</span>  The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">18:10</span>  The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.<br />
<span class="w">18:11</span>  More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br />
<span class="w">18:12</span>  For thy servant keepeth them, * and in keeping them there is a great reward.<br />
<span class="w">18:13</span>  Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: * and from those of others spare thy servant.<br />

<span class="w">33:11</span>  The rich have wanted, and have suffered hunger: * but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good.<br />
<span class="w">33:12</span>  Come, children, hearken to me: * I will teach you the fear of the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">33:13</span>  Who is the man that desireth life: * who loveth to see good days?<br />

<span class="w">1</span> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in the midst of the captives by the river Chobar, the heavens were opened, and I saw the visions of God.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> On the fifth day of the month, the same was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joachin,<br />
<span class="w">3</span> The word of the Lord came to Ezechiel the priest the son of Buzi in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chobar: and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And I saw, and behold a whirlwind came out of the north: and a great cloud, and a fire infolding it, and brightness was about it: and out of the midst thereof, that is, out of the midst of the fire, as it were the resemblance of amber.<br />

From the Book on Ecclesiastical Writers, written by St. Jerome, Priest <span class="w">at Bethlehem.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Cap. 7</span><br />
Luke was a physician of Antioch, who, as appeareth from his writings, knew the Greek language. He was a follower of the Apostle Paul, and his fellow traveller in all his wanderings. He wrote a Gospel, whereof the same Paul saith We have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the Churches <span class="w">2 Cor. viii. 18.</span> Of him, he writeth unto the Colossians, <span class="w">iv. 14</span>: Luke, the beloved physician, greeteth you. And again, unto Timothy, <span class="w">II. iv. 11</span>: Only Luke is with me. He also published another excellent book entitled The Acts of the Apostles, wherein the history is brought down to Paul's two years sojourn at Rome, that is to say, until the fourth year of Nero, from which we gather that it was at Rome that the said book was composed.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I saw men standing together, clad in shining raiment, and the Angel of the Lord spoke unto me, saying:<br />
* These men are holy, for they are the friends of God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> I saw a strong Angel of God fly into the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice:<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> These men are holy, for they are the friends of God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May Christ to all His people give, for ever in His sight to live. Amen.<br />

The silence of Luke is one of the reasons why we reckon among Apocryphal books The Acts of Paul and Thecla, and the whole story about the baptism of Leo. For why should the fellow traveller of the Apostle, who knew other things, be ignorant only of this? At the same time there is against these documents the statement of Tertullian, almost a contemporary writer, that the Apostle John convicted a certain Priest in Asia, who was a great admirer of the Apostle Paul, of having written them, and that the said Priest owned that he had been induced to compose them through his admiration for Paul, and that he was deposed in consequence. There are some persons who suspect that when Paul in his Epistles useth the phrase: "According to my Gospel" <span class="w">Rom. ii. 16, Tim. ii. 8,</span> he meaneth the Gospel written by Luke.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake;<br />
* Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> When men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Spirit's fire Divine in our hearts enkindled shine. Amen. <br />

However, Luke learned his Gospel not from the Apostle Paul only, who had not companied with the Lord in the flesh, but also from other Apostles, as himself declareth at the beginning of his work, where he saith: “They delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word.” <span class="w">i. 2.</span> According to what he had heard, therefore, did he write his Gospel. As to the Acts of the Apostles, he composed them from his own personal knowledge. He was never married. He lived eighty-four years. He is buried at Constantinople, whither his bones were brought from Achaia in the twentieth year of Constantine, together with the relics of the Apostle Andrew.<br />

Dearly beloved brethren, our Lord and Saviour doth sometimes admonish us by words, and sometimes by works. Yea, His very works do themselves teach us for that which He doth silently His example still moveth us to copy. Behold how He sendeth forth His disciples to preach by two and two since there are two commandments to love, that is, a commandment to love God, and a commandment to love our neighbour and where there are not two, the one, being alone, hath not whereon to do the Lord's commandment. And no man can properly be said to love himself: for love tendeth outward toward our neighbour, if it be the love whereto the Gospel doth oblige us.<br />

Well also is it said that He sent them before His face into every city and place whither He Himself would come.
