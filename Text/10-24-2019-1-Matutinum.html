<span class="ri">Ant.</span> When Tobias went in, * he found a young man with his loins girded, and as it were ready to set forth, and knowing not that it was an Angel, he saluted him.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 8</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">8:2</span>  O Lord our Lord, * how admirable is thy name in the whole earth!<br />
<span class="w">8:2</span>  For thy magnificence is elevated * above the heavens.<br />
<span class="w">8:3</span>  Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise, because of thy enemies, * that thou mayst destroy the enemy and the avenger.<br />
<span class="w">8:4</span>  For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: * the moon and the stars which thou hast founded.<br />
<span class="w">8:5</span>  What is man that thou art mindful of him? * or the son of man that thou visitest him?<br />
<span class="w">8:6</span>  Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour: * and hast set him over the works of thy hands.<br />
<span class="w">8:8</span>  Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, * all sheep and oxen: moreover the beasts also of the fields.<br />
<span class="w">8:9</span>  The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, * that pass through the paths of the sea.<br />
<span class="w">8:10</span>  O Lord our Lord, * how admirable is thy name in all the earth!<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 10</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">10:2</span>  In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: * Get thee away from hence to the mountain, like a sparrow?<br />
<span class="w">10:3</span>  For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow: they have prepared their arrows in the quiver, * to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.<br />
<span class="w">10:4</span>  For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: * but what has the just man done?<br />
<span class="w">10:5</span>  The Lord is in his holy temple, * the Lord’s throne is in heaven.<br />
<span class="w">10:5</span>  His eyes look on the poor man: * his eyelids examine the sons of men.<br />
<span class="w">10:6</span>  The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: * but he that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul.<br />
<span class="w">10:7</span>  He shall rain snares upon sinners: * fire and brimstone, and storms of winds, shall be the portion of their cup.<br />
<span class="w">10:8</span>  For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: * his countenance hath beheld righteousness.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="w">14:1</span>  Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest in thy holy hill?<br />
<span class="w">14:2</span>  He that walketh without blemish, * and worketh justice:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  He that speaketh truth in his heart, * who hath not used deceit in his tongue:<br />
<span class="w">14:3</span>  Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: * nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.<br />
<span class="w">14:4</span>  In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: * but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not; * He that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent:<br />
<span class="w">14:5</span>  He that doth these things, * shall not be moved for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">18:3</span>  Day to day uttereth speech, * and night to night sheweth knowledge.<br />
<span class="w">18:4</span>  There are no speeches nor languages, * where their voices are not heard.<br />
<span class="w">18:5</span>  Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: * and their words unto the ends of the world.<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: * and he, as a bridegroom coming out of his bride chamber,<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,<br />
<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">18:9</span>  The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">18:10</span>  The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.<br />
<span class="w">18:11</span>  More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br />
<span class="w">18:12</span>  For thy servant keepeth them, * and in keeping them there is a great reward.<br />
<span class="w">18:13</span>  Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: * and from those of others spare thy servant.<br />
<span class="w">18:14</span>  If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  O Lord, my helper, * and my redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Tob 12:1-4</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> Then Tobias called to him his son, and said to him: What can we give to this holy man, that is come with thee?<br />
<span class="w">2</span> Tobias answering, said to his father: Father, what wages shall we give him? or what can be worthy of his benefits?<br />
<span class="w">3</span> He conducted me and brought me safe again, he received the money of Gabelus, he caused me to have my wife, and he chased from her the evil spirit, he gave joy to her parents, myself he delivered from being devoured by the fish, thee also he hath made to see the light of heaven, and we are filled with all good things through him. What can we give him sufficient for these things?<br />
<span class="w">4</span> But I beseech thee, my father, to desire him, that he would vouchsafe to accept one half of all things that have been brought.<br />

<span class="w">5</span> So the father and the son, calling him, took him aside: and began to desire him that he would vouchsafe to accept of half of all things that they had brought.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> Then he said to them secretly: Bless ye the God of heaven, give glory to him in the sight of all that live, because he hath shewn his mercy to you.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> For it is good to hide the secret of a king: but honourable to reveal and confess the works of God.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> Prayer is good with fasting and alms more than to lay up treasures of gold:<br />

From the Sermons of St. Bonaventure, the Bishop<br />
<span class="ri">De Sanctis Angelis Sermo 5, sub fine</span><br />
Raphael means God's healing, and we should observe that the way out of evil lies through three blessing bestowed on us through Raphael's healing. For Raphael the Healer leads us forth from weakness of soul and brings us into the bitterness of contrition; whence in the book of Tobit Raphael says: When thou enterest into thy house, anoint his eyes with gall. He did so, and he saw. Why could not Raphael do this himself? Because an Angel does not bestow compunction, but he shows the way to it. By gall, the bitterness of contrition is to be understood, for it heals the inner eyes of the mind. The Psalmist says: He healeth those that are broken in heart. This is the best eye salve. In the second chapter of the Book of Judges it is written that an angel came up to the place of the weepers, and said to the people: I made you to go up out of Egypt; I have done all of these good things for you: and all the people wept, so that the place was called the Place of the Weepers. Dearly beloved, all day long the Angels are telling us of God's blessings, and recalling them to our minds: Who hath created thee? Who hath redeemed thee? What hast thou done? Whom hast thou offended? When thou considerest this, thine only remedy is to weep.  <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
