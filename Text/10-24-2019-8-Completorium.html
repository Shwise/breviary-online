<span class="w">69:2</span>  O God, come to my assistance; * O Lord, make haste to help me.<br />
<span class="w">69:3</span>  Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek my soul:<br />
<span class="w">69:4</span>  Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame * that desire evils to me:<br />

<span class="w">69:5</span>  Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; * and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.<br />

<span class="w">70:7</span>  Of thee shall I continually sing: * I am become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper.<br />
<span class="w">70:8</span>  Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; * thy greatness all the day long.<br />
<span class="w">70:9</span>  Cast me not off in the time of old age: * when my strength shall fail, do not thou forsake me.<br />
<span class="w">70:10</span>  For my enemies have spoken against me; * and they that watched my soul have consulted together,<br />
<span class="w">70:11</span>  Saying: God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, * for there is none to deliver him.<br />

<span class="w">70:20</span>  How great troubles hast thou shewn me, many and grievous: and turning thou hast brought me to life, * and hast brought me back again from the depths of the earth:<br />
<span class="w">70:21</span>  Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence; * and turning to me thou hast comforted me.<br />
<span class="w">70:22</span>  For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments of psaltery: * O God, I will sing to thee with the harp,<br />
<span class="w">70:23</span>  My lips shall greatly rejoice, when I shall sing to thee; * and my soul which thou hast redeemed.<br />
<span class="w">70:24</span>  Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day; * when they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me.<br />

<i class="a">B</i>efore the ending of the day,<br />
Creator of the world, we pray<br />

From nightly fears and fantasies;<br />
Tread under foot our ghostly foe,<br />

Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
