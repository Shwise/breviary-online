<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>h' eternal gifts of Christ the King,<br />
The Apostles' glory, let us sing;<br />
And all with hearts of gladness raise<br />
Due hymns of thankful love and praise.<br />
 <br />
For they the Church's princes are,<br />
Triumphant leaders in the war,<br />
The heavenly King's own warrior band,<br />
True lights to lighten every land.<br />
 <br />
Theirs was the steadfast faith of saints,<br />
The hope that never yields nor faints,<br />
The love of Christ in perfect glow,<br />
That lay the prince of this world low.<br />
 <br />
In them the Father's glory shone,<br />
In them the Spirit's will was done,<br />
The Son himself exults in them;<br />
Joy fills the new Jerusalem.<br />
 <br />
* Praise to the Father, with the Son,<br />
And Holy Spirit, Three in One;<br />
As ever was in ages past,<br />
And so shall be while ages last.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 18</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">18:2</span>  The heavens shew forth the glory of God, * and the firmament declareth the work of his hands.<br />
<span class="w">18:3</span>  Day to day uttereth speech, * and night to night sheweth knowledge.<br />
<span class="w">18:4</span>  There are no speeches nor languages, * where their voices are not heard.<br />
<span class="w">18:5</span>  Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: * and their words unto the ends of the world.<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: * and he, as a bridegroom coming out of his bride chamber,<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,<br />
<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">18:9</span>  The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">18:10</span>  The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.<br />
<span class="w">18:11</span>  More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br />
<span class="w">18:12</span>  For thy servant keepeth them, * and in keeping them there is a great reward.<br />
<span class="w">18:13</span>  Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: * and from those of others spare thy servant.<br />
<span class="w">18:14</span>  If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  O Lord, my helper, * and my redeemer.<br />

<span class="w">33:6</span>  Come ye to him and be enlightened: * and your faces shall not be confounded.<br />
<span class="w">33:7</span>  This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him: * and saved him out of all his troubles.<br />
<span class="w">33:8</span>  The Angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him: * and shall deliver them.<br />
<span class="w">33:9</span>  O taste, and see that the Lord is sweet: * blessed is the man that hopeth in him.<br />
<span class="w">33:10</span>  Fear the Lord, all ye his saints: * for there is no want to them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">33:11</span>  The rich have wanted, and have suffered hunger: * but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good.<br />
<span class="w">33:12</span>  Come, children, hearken to me: * I will teach you the fear of the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">33:13</span>  Who is the man that desireth life: * who loveth to see good days?<br />
<span class="w">33:14</span>  Keep thy tongue from evil, * and thy lips from speaking guile.<br />

<span class="w">33:17</span>  But the countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil things: * to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.<br />
<span class="w">33:18</span>  The just cried, and the Lord heard them: * and delivered them out of all their troubles.<br />
<span class="w">33:19</span>  The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: * and he will save the humble of spirit.<br />

<span class="w">33:21</span>  The Lord keepeth all their bones, * not one of them shall be broken.<br />
<span class="w">33:22</span>  The death of the wicked is very evil: * and they that hate the just shall be guilty.<br />

<span class="w">44:8</span>  Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: * therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br />
<span class="w">44:9</span>  Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: * out of which the daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory.<br />

Beginning of the letter of the blessed Apostle Jude<br />
<span class="ri">Jude 1:1-4</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James: to them that are beloved in God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> Mercy unto you, and peace, and charity be fulfilled.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> Dearly beloved, taking all care to write unto you concerning your common salvation, I was under a necessity to write unto you: to beseech you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> For certain men are secretly entered in, (who were written of long ago unto this judgment,) ungodly men, turning the grace of our Lord God into riotousness, and denying the only sovereign Ruler, and our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves, said the Lord:<br />
* Be ye, therefore, wise as serpents and simple as doves.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Be ye therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves.<br />

<b>Reading 2</b><br />
<span class="ri">Jude 1:5-8</span><br />
<span class="w">5</span> I will therefore admonish you, though ye once knew all things, that Jesus, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, did afterwards destroy them that believed not:<br />
<span class="w">6</span> And the angels who kept not their principality, but forsook their own habitation, he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains, unto the judgment of the great day.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> As Sodom and Gomorrha, and the neighbouring cities, in like manner, having given themselves to fornication, and going after other flesh, were made an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> In like manner these men also defile the flesh, and despise dominion, and blaspheme majesty.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Take up my yoke upon you, said the Lord, and learn of me, because I am meek, and humble of heart.<br />
* For my yoke is sweet and my burden light.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And you shall find rest to your souls.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For my yoke is sweet and my burden light.<br />

<span class="ri">Jude 1:9-13</span><br />
<span class="w">9</span> When Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil, contended about the body of Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech, but said: The Lord command thee.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not: and what things soever they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are corrupted.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain: and after the error of Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves, and have perished in the contradiction of Core.<br />
<span class="w">12</span> These are spots in their banquets, feasting together without fear, feeding themselves, clouds without water, which are carried about by winds, trees of the autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the roots,<br />
<span class="w">13</span> Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own confusion; wandering stars, to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> But when they shall deliver you up to the judges, take no thought how or what to speak:<br />
* for it shall be given you in that hour what to speak:<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For it is not you that speak, but the spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.<br />

They met together afterwards in Persia, where they begat countless children in Jesus Christ, spread the faith far and wide in those lands, amid raging heathens, and glorified together by their teaching and miracles, and, in the end, by a glorious martyrdom, the most holy name of Jesus Christ.<br />

Sermon of St. Gregory, Pope<br />
<span class="ri">Sermon 30 on the Gospels</span><br />
It is written: By His Spirit the Lord hath adorned the heavens. <span class="w">Job xxvi. 13.</span> Now the ornament of the heavens are the godly powers of preachers, and this ornament, what it is, Paul teacheth us thus To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will. <span class="w">1 Cor. xii. 8.</span><br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake;<br />
* Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> When men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Spirit's fire Divine in our hearts enkindled shine. Amen. <br />

So much power then as have preachers, so much ornament have the heavens. Wherefore again it is written By the word of the Lord were the heavens made. <span class="w">Ps. xxxii. 6.</span> For the Word of the Lord is the Son of the Father. But, to the end that all the Holy Trinity may be made manifest as the Maker of the heavens, that is, of the Apostles, it is straightway added touching God the Holy Ghost: you and all the host of them by the Breath of His mouth. Therefore the might of the same heavens is the might of the Spirit, for they had not braved the powers of this world, unless the strength of the Holy Ghost had comforted them. For we know what manner of men the Teachers of the Holy Church were before the coming of this Spirit and since He came we see in Whose strength they are made strong.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

<b>Reading 7</b><br />
From the holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 15:17-25</span><br />
at that time, Jesus said to his disciples: These things I command you, that you love one another. If the world hate you, know ye, that it hath hated me before you. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo.</span><br />
<span class="ri">87th Tract on John.</span><br />
In the reading from the Gospel, the last before this, the Lord had said: Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go, and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My Name, He may give it you. And here He saith These things I command you, that ye love one another. And by this it is that we must understand what fruit from us it is, whereof He saith I have chosen, that ye should go, and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain, and so the words added That whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My Name, He may give it you. He will give unto us when we love one another, since this (mutual love) is itself the gift of Him Who hath chosen us when as yet we were fruitless, since it hath not been we who have chosen Him, (but He Who hath chosen us,) and ordained us, that we should go, and bring forth fruit, that is to say, should love one another.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> These are they who while yet they lived in the flesh, planted the Church in their own blood;<br />

<span class="ri">V.</span> Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They drank of the Lord's cup, and became the friends of God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>They whose feast-day we are keeping, be our Advocates with God. Amen <br />

Love then, is the fruit which we should bring forth, and the Apostle Paul telleth us <span class="w">1 Tim. i. 5</span> that this love is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned. This is the love wherewith we love our neighbour, the love wherewith we love God, for we do not really love our neighbour unless we love God. For if any man love God, he loveth his neighbour as himself, since he that loveth not God loveth not himself. For on these two commandments hangeth all the law and the Prophets. Love, then, is the fruit which we should bring forth. And concerning this fruit, the Lord giveth us this commandment These things (saith He) I command you, that ye love one another. Hence also the Apostle Paul <span class="w">Gal. v. 22</span> when he is about praising up the fruits of the Spirit as opposed to the works of the flesh, saith first of all: The fruit of the Spirit is love. And from that as the beginning he draweth out a string of other fruits, as thence begotten and thereto bound, namely, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, chastity.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

<b>Reading 9</b><br />
Who is really joyful that loveth not the cause of his joy? Who can really be at one with another, unless he loveth that other? Who is cheerful under long toil for a good work, unless he loveth the aim? Who is kind, unless he love the object of his tenderness? Who is good, unless by the persuasion of love? Who is truly faithful, unless by the faith which worketh by love? Who is gentle to any use, unless love move him? Who turneth away from baseness unless he love honour? Well, then, doth the Good Master so often command us to love, as though that commandment were all-sufficient, for love is that gift without which all other good things avail nothing, and which cannot be without having every other good gift which maketh a good man good.<br />
