<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> Christ, thy guilty people spare!<br />
Lo, kneeling at thy gracious throne,<br />
thy Virgin-Mother pours her prayer,<br />
Imploring pardon for her own.<br />
 <br />
Ye angels, happy evermore!<br />
Who in your circles nine ascend,<br />
As ye have guarded us before,<br />
So still from harm our steps defend.<br />
 <br />
Ye prophets and Apostles high!<br />
Behold our penitential tears;<br />
And plead for us when death is nigh,<br />
our all-searching judge appears.<br />
 <br />
Ye martyrs all! a purple band,<br />
And confessors, a white-robed train;<br />
Oh, call us to our native land,<br />
From this our exile, back again.<br />
 <br />
And ye, O choirs of virgins chaste!<br />
Receive us to your seats on high;<br />
With hermits whom the desert waste<br />
Sent up of old into the sky.<br />
 <br />
Drive from the flock, O Spirit blest!<br />
The false and faithless race away;<br />
That all within one fold may rest,<br />
Secure beneath one shepherd's sway.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father glory be,<br />
And to his sole-begotten Son;<br />
And glory, Holy Ghost, to thee,<br />
While everlasting ages run.<br />
Amen.<br />

Lesson from the Apocalypse of St. John<br />
<span class="ri">Rev 4:2-8</span><br />
<span class="w">2</span> And immediately I was in the spirit: and behold there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And he that sat, was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine stone; and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats, four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments, and on their heads were crowns of gold.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second living creature like a calf: and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a man: and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; and round about and within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and the whole earth was full of His glory;<br />
* And His train filled the temple.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Above it stood the Seraphim each one had six wings.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And His train filled the temple.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Son, the Sole-begotten, mercifully bless and keep us. Amen. <br />

<span class="ri">Rev 5:1-8</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> And I saw a strong angel, proclaiming with a loud voice: Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And no man was able, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look on it.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book, nor to see it.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> And one of the ancients said to me: Weep not; behold the lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the ancients, a Lamb standing as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures, and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints:<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O Virgin Mary, Mother of God, blessed art thou that didst believe the Lord, for there hath been a performance of those things which were told thee from the Lord. Behold, thou art exalted over choirs of Angels.<br />
* Plead for us with the Lord our God.<br />

<span class="w">10</span> And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.<br />

<span class="w">12</span> Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> And every creature, which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them: I heard all saying: To him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, benediction, and honour, and glory, and power, for ever and ever.<br />

From the Sermons of the Venerable Bede, Priest <span class="w">at Jarrow.</span><br />
<span class="ri">18th upon the Saints.</span><br />
Dearly beloved brethren: This day we keep, with one great cry of joy, a Feast in memory of all God's holy children; His children, whose presence is a gladness to heaven; His children, whose prayers are a blessing to earth; His children, whose victories are the crown of the Holy Church; His chosen, whose testifying is the more glorious in honour, as the agony in which it was given was the sterner in intensity, for as the dreader grew the battle, so the grander grew the fighters, and the triumph of martyrdom waxed the more incisive by the multiplicity of suffering, and the heavier the torment the heavier the prize. And it is our Mother, the Catholic Church, spread far and wide throughout all this planet, it is she that hath learnt, in Christ Jesus her Head, not to fear shame, nor cross, nor death, but hath waxed lealer and lealer, and, not by fighting, but by enduring, hath breathed into all that noble band who have come up to the bitter starting-post the hope of conquest and glory which hath warmed them manfully to accept the race.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Fore-runner of the Lord cometh, to whom He Himself bare witness, saying:<br />

If a verity thou art blessed, O my Mother the Church! The blaze of God's mercy beateth full upon thee; thine adornment is the glorious blood of victorious Martyrs, and thy raiment the virgin whiteness of untarnished orthodoxy. thy garlands lack neither roses nor lilies. And now, dearly beloved brethren, let each one of us strive to gain the goodly crown of one sort or the other, either the glistening whiteness of purity, or the red dye of suffering. In the army in heaven peace and war have both chaplets of their own, to crown Christ's soldiers withal.<br />

Moreover, to this also hath the unutterable and boundless goodness of God seen, that He spreadeth not the time of working and wrestling, neither maketh it long, nor everlasting, and, as it were, but for a moment, so that in this short and scanty life there is wrestling and working, but the crown and the prize is in a life which is eternal. So the work is soon over, but the wage is paid for ever. And when the night of this world is over, the Saints are to see the clearness of the essential light, and to receive a blessedness outweighing the pangs of any torment, as testifieth the Apostle Paul, where he saith: The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. <span class="w">Rom. viii. 18.</span><br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 5:1-12</span><br />
At that time: Jesus, seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain, and when he was set down, his disciples came unto him. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Bk. i. on the Lord's Sermon.</span><br />
If it be asked what is signified by the mountain, the said mountain may well be understood to figure the higher and greater commandments of righteousness, since those that have been given to the Jews are the lesser. The one God, in an excellent order of times, gave, by His holy Prophets and servants, His lesser commandments unto the people whom it still behoved to be bound by fear, but by His Son He gave the greater unto the people whom it now beseemed to set free by love. But whether it be the lesser to the lesser, or the greater to the greater, all are alike the gift of Him Who alone knoweth what is in each epoch the seasonable medicine of mankind.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;<br />
* And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />
 <br />
<b>Reading 8</b><br />
Neither is it marvel that the greater commandments be given touching the kingdom of heaven, and the lesser touching a commonwealth upon earth, since both are alike the gifts of that one God Who is the Maker alike of heaven and of earth. The higher and greater righteousness, then, is that whereof the Prophet saith: Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God. <span class="w">Ps. xxxv. 7.</span> Thus is that Teacher, Who alone can give such teaching, mystically represented as teaching upon a mountain. And when He was set. The attitude of sitting while teaching appertaineth to the majesty of His instruction. His disciples came unto Him nearer in the body, to hear those precepts, by the fulfillment of which they should be nearer in spirit. And He opened His Mouth, and taught them, saying These words And He opened His Mouth, appear redundant to the sense. It may possibly be that this more pompous introduction is adopted on account of the exceptional length of the discourse to follow. But it may also be that these words are not really redundant, but the pointed declaration that He now opened His Own Mouth, Who, under the Old Law, had been used to open the mouths of the Prophets.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

And now, what saith He? Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. We have read where it is written concerning the lusting after temporal things: The wandering of the desire is vanity and presumption of spirit. <span class="w">Eccl. vi. 9.</span> Presumption of spirit signifieth rashness and pride. We are used to say of proud people that they are men of high spirit, and we say well, since spirit is only one of the Latin names for wind. It is so used, for instance, in Ps. cxlviii. 8, Fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy wind. Who hath not heard the proud spoken of as puffed up, as if they were blown out with wind? Hence, alas, the Apostle saith: Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. <span class="w">1 Cor. viii. 1.</span> By the poor in spirit, who are here called blessed, are rightly to be understood such as are lowly and fear God, that is, have not got minds puffed up with windy vanity.<br />
