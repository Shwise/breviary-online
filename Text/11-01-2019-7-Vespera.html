<span class="w">109:1</span>  The Lord said to my Lord: * Sit thou at my right hand:<br />
<span class="w">109:1</span>  Until I make thy enemies * thy footstool.<br />
<span class="w">109:2</span>  The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion: * rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.<br />

<span class="w">109:4</span>  The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent: * Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.<br />
<span class="w">109:5</span>  The Lord at thy right hand * hath broken kings in the day of his wrath.<br />
<span class="w">109:6</span>  He shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins: * he shall crush the heads in the land of many.<br />

<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Rev 7:2-3</span><br />
<i class="a">A</i>nd I, John, saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the sign of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying: Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we sign the servants of our God in their foreheads.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i> Christ, thy guilty people spare!<br />
Lo, kneeling at thy gracious throne,<br />
thy Virgin-Mother pours her prayer,<br />
Imploring pardon for her own.<br />
 <br />
Ye angels, happy evermore!<br />
Who in your circles nine ascend,<br />
As ye have guarded us before,<br />
So still from harm our steps defend.<br />
 <br />
Ye prophets and Apostles high!<br />
Behold our penitential tears;<br />
And plead for us when death is nigh,<br />
our all-searching judge appears.<br />
 <br />
Ye martyrs all! a purple band,<br />
And confessors, a white-robed train;<br />
Oh, call us to our native land,<br />
From this our exile, back again.<br />
 <br />
And ye, O choirs of virgins chaste!<br />
Receive us to your seats on high;<br />
With hermits whom the desert waste<br />
Sent up of old into the sky.<br />
 <br />
Drive from the flock, O Spirit blest!<br />
The false and faithless race away;<br />
That all within one fold may rest,<br />
Secure beneath one shepherd's sway.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father glory be,<br />
And to his sole-begotten Son;<br />
And glory, Holy Ghost, to thee,<br />
While everlasting ages run.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Let the Saints be joyful in glory.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Let them sing aloud upon their beds.<br />

<span class="w">1:50</span> And his mercy is from generation unto generations, * to them that fear him.<br />

<span class="w">1:52</span> He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble.<br />
<span class="w">1:53</span> He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
<span class="w">1:54</span> He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy:<br />
<span class="w">1:55</span> As he spoke to our fathers, * to Abraham and to his seed for ever.<br />
