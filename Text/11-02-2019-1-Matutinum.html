<b>Reading 4</b><br />
From the book of St. Augustine, the Bishop, on the Care for the Deceased<br />
<span class="ri">Cap 2 and 3</span><br />
If this be true, doubtless also the providing for the interment of bodies a place at the Memorials of Saints, is a mark of a good human affection towards the remains of one's friends. Yet it follows not that the bodies of the departed are to be despised and flung aside, and above all of just and faithful men, which bodies as organs and vessels to all good works their spirit has holily used. For if a father's garment and ring, and whatever such like, is the more dear to those whom they leave behind, the greater their affection is towards their parents, in no wise are the bodies themselves to be spurned, which truly we wear in more familiar and close conjunction than any of our putting on. For these pertain not to ornament or aid which is applied from without, but to the very nature of man. Whence also the funerals of the just men of old were with dutiful piety cared for, and their obsequies celebrated, and sepulture provided: and themselves while living did touching burial or even translation of their bodies give charge to their sons.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Remember, O God, that my life is wind.<br />
* The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord! Lord, hear my voice.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more.<br />

<span class="ri">Cap 4</span><br />
And when this affection is exhibited to the departed by faithful men who were most dear to them, there is no doubt that it profits them who while living in the body merited that such things should profit them after this life. But even if some necessity should through absence of all facility not allow bodies to be interred, or in such places interred, yet should there be no pretermitting of supplications for the spirits of the dead: which supplications, that they should be made for all in Christian and catholic fellowship departed, even without mentioning of their names, under a general commemoration, the Church has charged herself withal; to the intent that they which lack, for these offices, parents or sons or whatever kindred or friends, may have the same afforded unto them by the one pious mother which is common to all. But if there were lack of these supplications, which are made with right faith and piety for the dead, I account that it should not a whit profit their spirits, howsoever in holy places the lifeless bodies should be deposited.<br />
 <br />

<span class="ri">Cap 18</span><br />
Which things being so, let us not think that to the dead for whom we have a care, any thing reaches save what by sacrifices either of the altar, or of prayers, or of alms, we solemnly supplicate: although not to all for whom they are done be they profitable, but to them only by whom while they live it is obtained that they should be profitable. But forasmuch as we discern not who these be, it is meet to do them for all regenerate persons, that none of them may be passed by to whom these benefits may and ought to reach. For better it is that these things shall be superfluously done to them whom they neither hinder nor help, than lacking to them whom they help. More diligently however does each man these things for his own near and dear friends, in order that they may be likewise done unto him by his. But as for the burying of the body, whatever is bestowed on that, is no aid of salvation, but an office of humanity, according to that affection by which no man ever hates his own flesh. Whence it is fitting that he take what care he is able for the flesh of his neighbor, when he is gone that bare it. And if they do these things who believe not the resurrection of the flesh, how much more are they beholden to do the same who do believe; that so, an office of this kind bestowed upon a body, dead but yet to rise again and to remain to eternity, may also be in some sort a testimony of the same faith?<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 39</span><em> [7]</em><br />
<span class="w">39:2</span>  With expectation I have waited for the Lord, * and he was attentive to me.<br />
<span class="w">39:3</span>  And he heard my prayers, * and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs.<br />
<span class="w">39:3</span>  And he set my feet upon a rock, * and directed my steps.<br />
<span class="w">39:4</span>  And he put a new canticle into my mouth, * a song to our God.<br />
<span class="w">39:4</span>  Many shall see, and shall fear: * and they shall hope in the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">39:5</span>  Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; * and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.<br />
<span class="w">39:6</span>  Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God: * and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee.<br />
<span class="w">39:6</span>  I have declared and I have spoken * they are multiplied above number.<br />
<span class="w">39:7</span>  Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; * but thou hast pierced ears for me.<br />
<span class="w">39:7</span>  Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require: * then said I, Behold I come.<br />
<span class="w">39:8</span>  In the head of the book it is written of me that I should do thy will: * O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart.<br />
<span class="w">39:10</span>  I have declared thy justice in a great church, * lo, I will not restrain my lips: O Lord, thou knowest it.<br />
<span class="w">39:11</span>  I have not hid thy justice within my heart: * I have declared thy truth and thy salvation.<br />
<span class="w">39:11</span>  I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth * from a great council.<br />
<span class="w">39:12</span>  Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me: * thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.<br />
<span class="w">39:13</span>  For evils without number have surrounded me; * my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see.<br />
<span class="w">39:13</span>  They are multiplied above the hairs of my head: * and my heart hath forsaken me.<br />
<span class="w">39:14</span>  Be pleased, O Lord to deliver me: * look down, O Lord, to help me.<br />

<span class="w">40:6</span>  My enemies have spoken evils against me: * when shall he die and his name perish?<br />
<span class="w">40:7</span>  And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things: * his heart gathered together iniquity to itself.<br />

From the first letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians<br />
<span class="ri">1 Cor 15:12-22</span><br />
<span class="w">12</span> Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead?<br />
<span class="w">13</span> But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.<br />
<span class="w">15</span> Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ; whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.<br />
<span class="w">16</span> For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.<br />
<span class="w">17</span> And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain, for you are yet in your sins.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished.<br />
<span class="w">19</span> If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.<br />
<span class="w">20</span> But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep<br />
<span class="w">21</span> For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.<br />
<span class="w">22</span> And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Forasmuch as I sin daily, and repent not, the fear of death troubleth me.<br />
* O God, have mercy upon me, and save me, for in hell there is no redemption.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy strength.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O God, have mercy upon me, and save me, for in hell there is no redemption.<br />

<span class="ri">1 Cor 15:35-44</span><br />
<span class="w">35</span> But some man will say: How do the dead rise again? or with what manner of body shall they come?<br />
<span class="w">36</span> Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.<br />
<span class="w">37</span> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be; but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.<br />
<span class="w">38</span> But God giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body.<br />
<span class="w">39</span> All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes.<br />
<span class="w">40</span> And there are bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.<br />
<span class="w">41</span> One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory.<br />
<span class="w">42</span> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption.<br />
<span class="w">43</span> It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory. It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power.<br />
<span class="w">44</span> It is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body.<br />
 <br />

<span class="w">51</span> Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed.<br />
<span class="w">52</span> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise again incorruptible: and we shall be changed.<br />
<span class="w">53</span> For this corruptible must put on incorruption; and this mortal must put on immortality.<br />
<span class="w">54</span> And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.<br />
<span class="w">55</span> O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?<br />
<span class="w">56</span> Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law.<br />
<span class="w">57</span> But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
