<b>Psalms</b> <em>{Psalms and antiphons  from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The bones which thou hast broken * may rejoice.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 50</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.<br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">50:13</span>  Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br />
<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />
<span class="w">50:15</span>  I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.<br />
<span class="w">50:16</span>  Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And let perpetual light * shine upon them.<br />

<span class="w">64:3</span>  O hear my prayer: * all flesh shall come to thee.<br />
<span class="w">64:4</span>  The words of the wicked have prevailed over us: * and thou wilt pardon our transgressions.<br />
<span class="w">64:5</span>  Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken to thee: * he shall dwell in thy courts.<br />
<span class="w">64:5</span>  We shall be filled with the good things of thy house; holy is thy temple, * wonderful in justice.<br />
<span class="w">64:6</span>  Hear us, O God our saviour, * who art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and in the sea afar off.<br />
<span class="w">64:7</span>  Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength, being girded with power: * who troublest the depth of the sea, the noise of its waves.<br />
<span class="w">64:8</span>  The Gentiles shall be troubled, and they that dwell in the uttermost borders shall be afraid at thy signs: * thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to be joyful.<br />
<span class="w">64:10</span>  Thou hast visited the earth, and hast plentifully watered it; * thou hast many ways enriched it.<br />
<span class="w">64:10</span>  The river of God is filled with water, thou hast prepared their food; * for so is its preparation.<br />
<span class="w">64:11</span>  Fill up plentifully the streams thereof, multiply its fruits; * it shall spring up and rejoice in its showers.<br />
<span class="w">64:12</span>  Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of thy goodness: * and thy fields shall be filled with plenty.<br />
<span class="w">64:13</span>  The beautiful places of the wilderness shall grow fat: * and the hills shall be girded about with joy.<br />
<span class="w">64:14</span>  The rams of the flock are clothed, and the vales shall abound with corn: * they shall shout, yea they shall sing a hymn.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And let perpetual light * shine upon them.<br />

<span class="w">62:2</span>  O God, my God, * to thee do I watch at break of day.<br />
<span class="w">62:2</span>  For thee my soul hath thirsted; * for thee my flesh, O how many ways!<br />
<span class="w">62:3</span>  In a desert land, and where there is no way, and no water: * so in the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory.<br />
<span class="w">62:4</span>  For thy mercy is better than lives: * thee my lips shall praise.<br />
<span class="w">62:5</span>  Thus will I bless thee all my life long: * and in thy name I will lift up my hands.<br />
<span class="w">62:6</span>  Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness: * and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.<br />
<span class="w">62:7</span>  If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in the morning: * because thou hast been my helper.<br />
<span class="w">62:8</span>  And I will rejoice under the covert of thy wings: my soul hath stuck close to thee: * thy right hand hath received me.<br />
<span class="w">62:10</span>  But they have sought my soul in vain, they shall go into the lower parts of the earth: * they shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the portions of foxes.<br />
<span class="w">62:12</span>  But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be praised that swear by him: * because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And let perpetual light * shine upon them.<br />

 <span class="w">(Canticle of Ezechias * Isa 38:10-23)</span> <br />
<span class="w">38:10</span>  I said: In the midst of my days * I shall go to the gates of hell:<br />
<span class="w">38:11</span>  I sought for the residue of my years. * I said: I shall not see the Lord God in the land of the living.<br />
<span class="w">38:12</span>  I shall behold man no more, * nor the inhabitant of rest.<br />
<span class="w">38:13</span>  My generation is at an end, and it is rolled away from me, * as a shepherdâ€™s tent.<br />
<span class="w">38:14</span>  My life is cut off, as by a weaver: whilst I was yet but beginning, he cut me off: * from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me.<br />
<span class="w">38:15</span>  I hoped till morning, * as a lion so hath he broken all my bones:<br />
<span class="w">38:16</span>  From morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me. * I will cry like a young swallow, I will meditate like a dove:<br />
<span class="w">38:17</span>  My eyes are weakened * looking upward:<br />
<span class="w">38:18</span>  Lord, I suffer violence, answer thou for me. * What shall I say, or what shall he answer for me, whereas he himself hath done it?<br />
<span class="w">38:19</span>  I will recount to thee all my years * in the bitterness of my soul.<br />
<span class="w">38:20</span>  O Lord, if manâ€™s life be such, and the life of my spirit be in such things as these, thou shalt correct me, and make me to live. * Behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter:<br />
<span class="w">38:21</span>  But thou hast delivered my soul that it should not perish, * thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.<br />
<span class="w">38:22</span>  For hell shall not confess to thee, neither shall death praise thee: * nor shall they that go down into the pit, look for thy truth.<br />
<span class="w">38:23</span>  The living, the living, he shall give praise to thee, as I do this day: * the father shall make thy truth known to the children.<br />
<span class="w">38:24</span>  O Lord, save me, and we will sing our psalms all the days of our life * in the house of the Lord.<br />
