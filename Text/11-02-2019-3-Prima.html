<span class="ri">Psalm 87</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">87:2</span>  Lord, the God of my salvation: * I have cried in the day, and in the night before thee.<br />
<span class="w">87:3</span>  Let my prayer come in before thee: * incline thy ear to my petition.<br />
<span class="w">87:4</span>  For my soul is filled with evils: * and my life hath drawn nigh to hell.<br />
<span class="w">87:5</span>  I am counted among them that go down to the pit: * I am become as a man without help, free among the dead.<br />
<span class="w">87:6</span>  Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres, whom thou rememberest no more: * and they are cast off from thy hand.<br />
<span class="w">87:7</span>  They have laid me in the lower pit: * in the dark places, and in the shadow of death.<br />
<span class="w">87:8</span>  Thy wrath is strong over me: * and all thy waves thou hast brought in upon me.<br />
<span class="w">87:9</span>  Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me: * they have set me an abomination to themselves.<br />
<span class="w">87:9</span>  I was delivered up, and came not forth: * my eyes languished through poverty.<br />
<span class="w">87:10</span>  All the day I cried to thee, O Lord: * I stretched out my hands to thee.<br />
<span class="w">87:11</span>  Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? * or shall physicians raise to life, and give praise to thee?<br />
<span class="w">87:12</span>  Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy: * and thy truth in destruction?<br />
<span class="w">87:13</span>  Shall thy wonders be known in the dark; * and thy justice in the land of forgetfulness?<br />
<span class="w">87:14</span>  But I, O Lord, have cried to thee: * and in the morning my prayer shall prevent thee.<br />
<span class="w">87:15</span>  Lord, why castest thou off my prayer: * why turnest thou away thy face from me?<br />
<span class="w">87:16</span>  I am poor, and in labours from my youth: * and being exalted have been humbled and troubled.<br />
<span class="w">87:17</span>  Thy wrath hath come upon me: * and thy terrors have troubled me.<br />
<span class="w">87:18</span>  They have come round about me like water all the day: * they have compassed me about together.<br />
<span class="w">87:19</span>  Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me: * and my acquaintance, because of misery.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And let perpetual light * shine upon them.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 27</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">27:1</span>  Unto thee will I cry, O Lord: my God, be not thou silent to me: * lest if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.<br />
<span class="w">27:2</span>  Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee; * when I lift up my hands to thy holy temple.<br />
<span class="w">27:3</span>  Draw me not away together with the wicked; * and with the workers of iniquity destroy me not:<br />
<span class="w">27:3</span>  Who speak peace with their neighbour, * but evils are in their hearts.<br />
<span class="w">27:4</span>  Give them according to their works, * and according to the wickedness of their inventions.<br />
<span class="w">27:4</span>  According to the works of their hands give thou to them: * render to them their reward.<br />
<span class="w">27:5</span>  Because they have not understood the works of the Lord, and the operations of his hands: * thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build them up.<br />
<span class="w">27:6</span>  Blessed be the Lord, * for he hath heard the voice of my supplication.<br />
<span class="w">27:7</span>  The Lord is my helper and my protector: * in him hath my heart confided, and I have been helped.<br />
<span class="w">27:7</span>  And my flesh hath flourished again, * and with my will I will give praise to him.<br />
<span class="w">27:8</span>  The Lord is the strength of his people, * and the protector of the salvation of his anointed.<br />
<span class="w">27:9</span>  Save, O Lord, thy people, and bless thy inheritance: * and rule them and exalt them for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And let perpetual light * shine upon them.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 31</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">31:1</span>  Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven * and whose sins are covered.<br />
<span class="w">31:2</span>  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin, * and in whose spirit there is no guile.<br />
<span class="w">31:3</span>  Because I was silent my bones grew old; * whilst I cried out all the day long.<br />
<span class="w">31:4</span>  For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: * I am turned in my anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.<br />
<span class="w">31:5</span>  I have acknowledged my sin to thee, * and my injustice I have not concealed.<br />
<span class="w">31:5</span>  I said I will confess against myself my injustice to the Lord: * and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.<br />
<span class="w">31:6</span>  For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee * in a seasonable time.<br />
<span class="w">31:6</span>  And yet in a flood of many waters, * they shall not come nigh unto him.<br />
<span class="w">31:7</span>  Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me: * my joy, deliver me from them that surround me.<br />
<span class="w">31:8</span>  I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this way, in which thou shalt go: * I will fix my eyes upon thee.<br />
<span class="w">31:9</span>  Do not become like the horse and the mule, * who have no understanding.<br />
<span class="w">31:9</span>  With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, * who come not near unto thee.<br />
<span class="w">31:10</span>  Many are the scourges of the sinner, * but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">31:11</span>  Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, * and glory, all ye right of heart.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And let perpetual light * shine upon them.<br />
