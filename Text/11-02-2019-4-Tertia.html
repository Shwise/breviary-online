<span class="ri">Psalm 37(1-11)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">37:2</span>  Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; * nor chastise me in thy wrath.<br />
<span class="w">37:3</span>  For thy arrows are fastened in me: * and thy hand hath been strong upon me.<br />
<span class="w">37:4</span>  There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath: * there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.<br />
<span class="w">37:5</span>  For my iniquities are gone over my head: * and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me.<br />
<span class="w">37:6</span>  My sores are putrified and corrupted, * because of my foolishness.<br />
<span class="w">37:7</span>  I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end: * I walked sorrowful all the day long.<br />
<span class="w">37:8</span>  For my loins are filled with illusions; * and there is no health in my flesh.<br />
<span class="w">37:9</span>  I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: * I roared with the groaning of my heart.<br />
<span class="w">37:10</span>  Lord, all my desire is before thee, * and my groaning is not hidden from thee.<br />
<span class="w">37:11</span>  My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, * and the light of my eyes itself is not with me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And let perpetual light * shine upon them.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 37(12-23)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">37:12</span>  My friends and my neighbours * have drawn near, and stood against me.<br />
<span class="w">37:12</span>  And they that were near me stood afar off: * and they that sought my soul used violence.<br />
<span class="w">37:13</span>  And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, * and studied deceits all the day long.<br />
<span class="w">37:14</span>  But I, as a deaf man, heard not: * and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.<br />
<span class="w">37:15</span>  And I became as a man that heareth not: * and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.<br />
<span class="w">37:16</span>  For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped: * thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.<br />
<span class="w">37:17</span>  For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me: * and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.<br />
<span class="w">37:18</span>  For I am ready for scourges: * and my sorrow is continually before me.<br />
<span class="w">37:19</span>  For I will declare my iniquity: * and I will think for my sin.<br />
<span class="w">37:20</span>  But my enemies live, and are stronger than I: * and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.<br />
<span class="w">37:21</span>  They that render evil for good, have detracted me, * because I followed goodness.<br />
<span class="w">37:22</span>  Forsake me not, O Lord my God: * do not thou depart from me.<br />
<span class="w">37:23</span>  Attend unto my help, * O Lord, the God of my salvation.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And let perpetual light * shine upon them.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 55</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">55:2</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; * all the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me.<br />
<span class="w">55:3</span>  My enemies have trodden on me all the day long; * for they are many that make war against me.<br />
<span class="w">55:4</span>  From the height of the day I shall fear: * but I will trust in thee.<br />
<span class="w">55:5</span>  In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust: * I will not fear what flesh can do against me.<br />
<span class="w">55:6</span>  All the day long they detested my words: * all their thoughts were against me unto evil.<br />
<span class="w">55:7</span>  They will dwell and hide themselves: * they will watch my heel.<br />
<span class="w">55:8</span>  As they have waited for my soul, for nothing shalt thou save them: * in thy anger thou shalt break the people in pieces.<br />
<span class="w">55:9</span>  O God, I have declared to thee my life: * thou hast set my tears in thy sight,<br />
<span class="w">55:9</span>  As also in thy promise. * Then shall my enemies be turned back.<br />
<span class="w">55:10</span>  In what day soever I shall call upon thee, * behold I know thou art my God.<br />
<span class="w">55:11</span>  In God will I praise the word, in the Lord will I praise his speech. * In God have I hoped, I will not fear what man can do to me.<br />
<span class="w">55:12</span>  In me, O God, are vows to thee, * which I will pay, praises to thee:<br />
<span class="w">55:13</span>  Because thou hast delivered my soul from death, my feet from falling: * that I may please in the sight of God, in the light of the living.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And let perpetual light * shine upon them.<br />
