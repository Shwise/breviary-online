<span class="ri">Psalm 69</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">69:2</span>  O God, come to my assistance; * O Lord, make haste to help me.<br />
<span class="w">69:3</span>  Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek my soul:<br />
<span class="w">69:4</span>  Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame * that desire evils to me:<br />
<span class="w">69:4</span>  Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame * that say to me: ’T is well, ’t is well.<br />
<span class="w">69:5</span>  Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; * and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.<br />
<span class="w">69:6</span>  But I am needy and poor; * O God, help me.<br />
<span class="w">69:6</span>  Thou art my helper and my deliverer: * O Lord, make no delay.<br />

<span class="w">84:2</span>  Lord, thou hast blessed thy land: * thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob.<br />
<span class="w">84:3</span>  Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: * thou hast covered all their sins.<br />
<span class="w">84:4</span>  Thou hast mitigated all thy anger: * thou hast turned away from the wrath of thy indignation.<br />
<span class="w">84:5</span>  Convert us, O God our saviour: * and turn off thy anger from us.<br />
<span class="w">84:6</span>  Wilt thou be angry with us for ever: * or wilt thou extend thy wrath from generation to generation?<br />
<span class="w">84:7</span>  Thou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: * and thy people shall rejoice in thee.<br />
<span class="w">84:8</span>  Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; * and grant us thy salvation.<br />
<span class="w">84:9</span>  I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: * for he will speak peace<br />
<span class="w">84:9</span>  And unto his saints: * and unto them that are converted to the heart.<br />
<span class="w">84:10</span>  Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him: * that glory may dwell in our land.<br />
<span class="w">84:11</span>  Mercy and truth have met each other: * justice and peace have kissed.<br />
<span class="w">84:12</span>  Truth is sprung out of the earth: * and justice hath looked down from heaven.<br />
<span class="w">84:13</span>  For the Lord will give goodness: * and our earth shall yield her fruit.<br />
<span class="w">84:14</span>  Justice shall walk before him: * and shall set his steps in the way.<br />

<span class="w">85:1</span>  Incline thy ear, O Lord, and hear me: * for I am needy and poor.<br />
<span class="w">85:2</span>  Preserve my soul, for I am holy: * save thy servant, O my God, that trusteth in thee.<br />
<span class="w">85:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I have cried to thee all the day. * Give joy to the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, I have lifted up my soul.<br />

<span class="w">85:11</span>  Conduct me, O Lord, in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth: * let my heart rejoice that it may fear thy name.<br />
<span class="w">85:12</span>  I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, * and I will glorify thy name for ever:<br />
<span class="w">85:13</span>  For thy mercy is great towards me: * and thou hast delivered my soul out of the lower hell.<br />
<span class="w">85:14</span>  O God, the wicked are risen up against me, and the assembly of the mighty have sought my soul: * and they have not set thee before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">85:15</span>  And thou, O Lord, art a God of compassion, and merciful, * patient, and of much mercy, and true.<br />
<span class="w">85:16</span>  O look upon me, and have mercy on me: * give thy command to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.<br />
<span class="w">85:17</span>  Shew me a token for good: that they who hate me may see, and be confounded, * because thou, O Lord, hast helped me and hast comforted me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Eternal rest * grant unto them, O Lord. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And let perpetual light * shine upon them.<br />
