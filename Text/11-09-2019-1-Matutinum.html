<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>hou heavenly, new Jerusalem,<br />
Vision of peace in prophet's dream!<br />
With living stones built up on high,<br />
And rising to yon starry sky;<br />
In bridal pomp thy form is crowned,<br />
With thousand thousand angels round!<br />
 <br />
O bride, betrothed in happy hour,<br />
The Father's glory is thy dower;<br />
The bridegroom's grace is shed on thee<br />
Thou queen all fair eternally;<br />
To Christ allied, thy Prince adored,<br />
Bright shining city of the Lord!<br />
 <br />
Behold with pearls they glittering stand<br />
thy peaceful gates to all expand;<br />
By grace and strength divinely shed<br />
Each mortal thither may be led;<br />
Who, kindled by Christ's love, will dare<br />
All earthly sufferings now to bear.<br />
 <br />
By many a salutary stroke,<br />
By many a weary blow that broke,<br />
Or polished with a workman's skill,<br />
The stones that form that glorious pile,<br />
They all are fitly framed to lie<br />
In their appointed place on high.<br />
 <br />
Fair and well pleasing in thy sight,<br />
Parent most high, enthroned in light,<br />
And for thine only Son most meet,<br />
And thee, all-glorious Paraclete,<br />
To whom praise, power, and glory rise<br />
Forever through the eternal skies.<br />
Amen.<br />

The Rites whereof the Church of Rome maketh use for the hallowing of Churches and Altars were first instituted by the blessed Pope Sylvester. From the very time of the Apostles there had been places set apart for God, where assemblies took place upon the first day of every week, and where the Christians were used to pray, to hear the word of God, and to receive the Eucharist, which places were by some called Oratories and by others Churches. But these places were not dedicated with so solemn a form, nor did they set up therein an Altar for a pillar, and pour chrism thereon, <span class="w">Gen. xxviii. 18,</span> for a figure of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who is Himself our Altar, our Victim, and our Priest.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

* Forgive the sin of thy people, O God, and teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and manifest forth thy glory in this place.<br />

But when the Emperor Constantine had by the Sacrament of Baptism received health both of body and soul, then first in a law by him published was it allowed to the Christians throughout the whole world to build Churches, to the which holy building he exhorted them by his example as well as by his decree. He dedicated in his own Lateran Palace a Church to the Saviour, and built hard by it a Cathedral in the name of St. John the Baptist, upon the place where he had been baptized by holy Sylvester and cleansed from his leprosy. This Cathedral was hallowed by the said Pope upon the 9th day of November. It is this consecration, the memory whereof is still celebrated upon this day, the first whereon the public consecration of a Church ever took place in Rome, and the image of the Saviour was seen by the Roman people painted upon the wall.<br />

The Blessed Sylvester afterwards decreed, when he was consecrating the Altar of the Prince of the Apostles, that Altars were thenceforward to be made of stone only, but notwithstanding this the Lateran Cathedral hath the altar made of wood. This is not surprising. From St. Peter to Sylvester the Popes had not been able, by reason of persecutions, to abide fixedly in one place, and they celebrated the Holy Liturgy in cellars, in burying-places, in the houses of godly persons, or wherever need drove them, upon a wooden altar made like an empty box. When peace was given to the Church, holy Sylvester took this box, and to do honour to the Prince of the Apostles, who is said to have offered sacrifice thereon, and to the other Popes who thereon had been used to execute the mystery even unto that time, set it in the first Church, even the Lateran, and ordained that no one but the Bishop of Rome should celebrate the Liturgy thereon for all time coming. The original Lateran Cathedral, cast down and destroyed by fires, pillage, and earthquakes, and renewed by the constant care of the Popes, was at last rebuilt afresh, and solemnly consecrated by Pope Benedict XIII, a Friar Preacher, upon the 28th day of April, in the year 1726, the memory of which Festival he ordained to be kept upon this day. In the year 1884 Leo XIII took in hand a work which had received the sanction of his predecessor Pius IX. The great sanctuary, the walls of which were giving way with age, was lengthened and widened, a task of immense labour. The ancient mosaic had been renewed previously in several places; it was now restored according to the original design, and transferred to the new apse, the embellishment of which was carried out with great magnificence. The transept was redecorated, and its ceiling and woodwork repaired. A sacristy, a residence for the canons, and a portico connecting with the baptistery of Constantine, were added to the existing buildings.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke<br />
<span class="ri">Luke 19:1-10</span><br />
At that time: Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Ambrose, Bishop <span class="w">of Milan.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Bk. viii. on Luke.</span><br />
Zacchaeus was little of stature, that is, he was not raised aloft among men by nobility of birth, and, like the most of the world, he possessed few merits. When he heard that the Lord and Saviour, Who had come unto His Own, and Whom His Own had not received, <span class="w">John i. 11,</span> was coming, he desired to see Him. But the sight of Jesus is not easy; to any on the earth it is impossible. And since Zacchaeus had neither the Prophets, nor yet the Law, as a gracious help to his nature, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, raising his feet above the vanity of the Jews, and straightening the crooked branches of his former life, and therefore he received Jesus to lodge within his house.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> My house shall be called the house of prayer, saith the Lord. Therein, he that asketh, receiveth; he that seeketh, findeth;<br />
* And to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />
 <br />

He did well to climb up into a tree, that a good tree might bring forth good fruits, <span class="w">Matth. vii. 17,</span> and that the slip of the wild olive, grafted, contrary to nature, into the good olive, might bring forth the fruits of the law. <span class="w">Rom. xi. 17, 24.</span> For the root is holy, however unprofitable the branches. Their barren beauty hath now been overshadowed by the belief of the Gentiles in the Resurrection, as by a material upgrowth. Zacchaeus, then, was in the sycamore tree, and the blind man by the way-side, <span class="w">xviii. 35.</span> For the one, Jesus stood waiting to show mercy, and asked him before He healed him, what he would that He should do for him; being unbidden of the other, He bade Himself to be his Guest, knowing how rich was the reward of receiving Him. Nevertheless, albeit He had heard no words of invitation, yet had He seen how his heart went.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> All thy walls are of stones most precious.<br />

But lest we should seem haughtily to pass by the poor blind man, and to hurry on to the rich one, let us stand waiting for him, as the Lord stood and waited; let us ask of him, as Christ asked of him. Let us ask, because we are ignorant; Christ asked, because He knew. Let us ask, that we may know whence he received his cure; Christ asked, that all of us may know from one example where through we are to earn a sight of the Lord. Christ asked, that we might believe that none, save they that confess Him, can be saved.<br />
