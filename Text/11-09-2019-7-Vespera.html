<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Rev 21:2</span><br />
<i class="a">I</i> saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">T</i>hou heavenly, new Jerusalem,<br />
Vision of peace in prophet's dream!<br />
With living stones built up on high,<br />
And rising to yon starry sky;<br />
In bridal pomp thy form is crowned,<br />
With thousand thousand angels round!<br />
 <br />
O bride, betrothed in happy hour,<br />
The Father's glory is thy dower;<br />
The bridegroom's grace is shed on thee<br />
Thou queen all fair eternally;<br />
To Christ allied, thy Prince adored,<br />
Bright shining city of the Lord!<br />
 <br />
Behold with pearls they glittering stand<br />
thy peaceful gates to all expand;<br />
By grace and strength divinely shed<br />
Each mortal thither may be led;<br />
Who, kindled by Christ's love, will dare<br />
All earthly sufferings now to bear.<br />
 <br />
By many a salutary stroke,<br />
By many a weary blow that broke,<br />
Or polished with a workman's skill,<br />
The stones that form that glorious pile,<br />
They all are fitly framed to lie<br />
In their appointed place on high.<br />
 <br />
Fair and well pleasing in thy sight,<br />
Parent most high, enthroned in light,<br />
And for thine only Son most meet,<br />
And thee, all-glorious Paraclete,<br />
To whom praise, power, and glory rise<br />
Forever through the eternal skies.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
