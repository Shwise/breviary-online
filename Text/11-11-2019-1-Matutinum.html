<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>his the confessor of the Lord, whose triumph<br />
Now all the faithful celebrate, with gladness<br />
On this feast day year by year receiveth<br />
Merited honors.<br />
 <br />
Saintly and prudent, modest in behaviour,<br />
Peaceful and sober, chaste was he, and lowly.<br />
While that life’s vigour, coursing through his members,<br />
Quickened his being.<br />
 <br />
Sick ones of old time, to his tomb resorting,<br />
Sorely by ailments manifold afflicted,<br />
Oft-times have welcomed health and strength returning,<br />
At his petition.<br />
 <br />
Whence we in chorus gladly do him honour,<br />
Chanting his praises with devout affection,<br />
That in his merits we may have a portion,<br />
Now and forever.<br />
 <br />
His be the glory, power and salvation,<br />
Who over all things reigneth in the highest,<br />
Earth’s mighty fabric ruling and directing,<br />
Onely and Trinal.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> While Martin * is yet a Catechumen, he hath clad Me in this garment.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 1</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">1:1</span>  Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, * nor sat in the chair of pestilence.<br />
<span class="w">1:2</span>  But his will is in the law of the Lord, * and on his law he shall meditate day and night.<br />
<span class="w">1:3</span>  And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running waters, * which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season.<br />
<span class="w">1:3</span>  And his leaf shall not fall off: * and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper.<br />
<span class="w">1:4</span>  Not so the wicked, not so: * but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.<br />
<span class="w">1:5</span>  Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: * nor sinners in the council of the just.<br />
<span class="w">1:6</span>  For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: * and the way of the wicked shall perish.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> While Martin is yet a Catechumen, he hath clad Me in this garment.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Martin * confessed the faith of the Holy Trinity, and received the grace of baptism.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 2</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">2:1</span>  Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?<br />
<span class="w">2:2</span>  The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, * against the Lord and against his Christ.<br />
<span class="w">2:3</span>  Let us break their bonds asunder: * and let us cast away their yoke from us.<br />
<span class="w">2:4</span>  He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: * and the Lord shall deride them.<br />
<span class="w">2:5</span>  Then shall he speak to them in his anger, * and trouble them in his rage.<br />
<span class="w">2:6</span>  But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain, * preaching his commandment.<br />
<span class="w">2:7</span>  The Lord hath said to me: * Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.<br />
<span class="w">2:8</span>  Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, * and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.<br />
<span class="w">2:9</span>  Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, * and shalt break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.<br />
<span class="w">2:10</span>  And now, O ye kings, understand: * receive instruction, you that judge the earth.<br />
<span class="w">2:11</span>  Serve ye the Lord with fear: * and rejoice unto him with trembling.<br />
<span class="w">2:12</span>  Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, * and you perish from the just way.<br />
<span class="w">2:13</span>  When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, * blessed are all they that trust in him.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 3</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">3:2</span>  Why, O Lord, are they multiplied that afflict me? * many are they who rise up against me.<br />
<span class="w">3:3</span>  Many say to my soul: * There is no salvation for him in his God.<br />
<span class="w">3:4</span>  But thou, O Lord art my protector, * my glory, and the lifter up of my head.<br />
<span class="w">3:5</span>  I have cried to the Lord with my voice: * and he hath heard me from his holy hill.<br />
<span class="w">3:6</span>  I have slept and taken my rest: * and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.<br />
<span class="w">3:7</span>  I will not fear thousands of the people, surrounding me: * arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.<br />
<span class="w">3:8</span>  For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause: * thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.<br />
<span class="w">3:9</span>  Salvation is of the Lord: * and thy blessing is upon thy people.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 4</span><em> [4]</em><br />

<span class="w">4:2</span>  Have mercy on me: * and hear my prayer.<br />
<span class="w">4:3</span>  O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? * Why do you love vanity, and seek after lying?<br />
<span class="w">4:4</span>  Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful: * the Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him.<br />
<span class="w">4:5</span>  Be ye angry, and sin not: * the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds.<br />
<span class="w">4:6</span>  Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord: * many say, Who sheweth us good things?<br />
<span class="w">4:7</span>  The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us: * thou hast given gladness in my heart.<br />
<span class="w">4:8</span>  By the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, * they are multiplied.<br />
<span class="w">4:9</span>  In peace in the selfsame * I will sleep, and I will rest:<br />

<span class="w">5:5</span>  In the morning I will stand before thee, and will see: * because thou art not a God that willest iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">5:6</span>  Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee: * nor shall the unjust abide before thy eyes.<br />
<span class="w">5:7</span>  Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity: * thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie.<br />
<span class="w">5:7</span>  The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor. * But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy,<br />

<span class="w">5:11</span>  Let them fall from their devices: according to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out: * for they have provoked thee, O Lord.<br />

<span class="w">10:2</span>  In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: * Get thee away from hence to the mountain, like a sparrow?<br />
<span class="w">10:3</span>  For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow: they have prepared their arrows in the quiver, * to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.<br />

Lesson from the first letter of St. Paul the Apostle to Timothy<br />
<span class="ri">1 Tim 3:1-7</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> A faithful saying: if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, given to hospitality, a teacher,<br />
<span class="w">3</span> Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not quarrelsome, not covetous, but<br />
<span class="w">4</span> One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all chastity.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?<br />
<span class="w">6</span> Not a neophyte: lest being puffed up with pride, he fall into the judgment of the devil.<br />
<span class="w">7</span> Moreover he must have a good testimony of them who are without: lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> This is that Martin whom God chose to be an High Priest unto Himself, he upon whom the Lord was pleased to bestow favour like as upon His Apostles;<br />
* So that he prevailed gloriously in the power of the Divine Trinity three times to raise the dead to life.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Martin confessed the faith of the Holy Trinity.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> So that he prevailed gloriously in the power of the Divine Trinity three times to raise the dead to life.<br />

From the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to Titus<br />
<span class="ri">Titus 1:7-11</span><br />
<span class="w">7</span> For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:<br />
<span class="w">8</span> But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:<br />
<span class="w">9</span> Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gainsayers.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision:<br />
<span class="w">11</span> Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.<br />
<span class="ri">Titus 2:1-8</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:<br />
<span class="w">2</span> That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:<br />
<span class="w">4</span> That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children,<br />
<span class="w">5</span> To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
Martin, born in Sabaria at Pannonia, was ten years old, when against his parents' wishes he went to a Church and asked to be enrolled amongst the catechumens. At fifteen he enlisted as a soldier, and served first in the army of Constantius, and then in that of Julian. At eighteen, when he had given part of his cloak to a poor man at Amiens, he was strengthened by a wonderful apparition of Jesus Christ and eagerly received baptism. Then leaving the military life, he was received among the acolytes of Hilary, the bishop of Poitiers. Later made bishop of Tours, he built a monastery, where with eighty monks he lived in a most holy way for some time. When he was seized with severe fever at Candes, a village of his diocese, he had pity on his disciples, and thus prayed to God: "Lord, if I am still necessary for your people, I will not refuse the labor." Shortly after, when death was imminent, the enemy of mankind appeared him. "Why are you here, cruel beast?", said Martin. "You will find no deadly sin in me." With those words he gave back his soul to God at the age of eighty one, famous for many miracles. <br />
