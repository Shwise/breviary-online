<span class="ri">Sir 44:16-17</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>ehold an high priest, who in his days pleased God, and was found righteous, and in the time of wrath he was made a propitiation.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">T</i>his the confessor of the Lord, whose triumph<br />
Now all the faithful celebrate, with gladness<br />
On this feast day year by year receiveth<br />
Merited honors.<br />
 <br />
Saintly and prudent, modest in behaviour,<br />
Peaceful and sober, chaste was he, and lowly.<br />
While that life’s vigour, coursing through his members,<br />
Quickened his being.<br />
 <br />
Sick ones of old time, to his tomb resorting,<br />
Sorely by ailments manifold afflicted,<br />
Oft-times have welcomed health and strength returning,<br />
At his petition.<br />
 <br />
Whence we in chorus gladly do him honour,<br />
Chanting his praises with devout affection,<br />
That in his merits we may have a portion,<br />
Now and forever.<br />
 <br />
His be the glory, power and salvation,<br />
Who over all things reigneth in the highest,<br />
Earth’s mighty fabric ruling and directing,<br />
Onely and Trinal.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The Lord guided the just in right paths.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And showed him the kingdom of God.<br />
