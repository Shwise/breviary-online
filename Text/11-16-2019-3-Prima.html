<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">N</i>ow in the sun’s new dawning ray,<br />
Lowly of heart, our God we pray<br />
That he from harm may keep us free<br />
In all the deeds this day shall see.<br />
 <br />
May fear of him our tongues restrain,<br />
Lest strife unguarded speech should stain:<br />
His favouring care our guardian be,<br />
Lest our eyes feed on vanity.<br />
 <br />
May every heart be pure from sin<br />
And folly find no place therein:<br />
Scant need of food, excess denied,<br />
Wear down in us the body’s pride.<br />
 <br />
That when the light of day is gone,<br />
And night in course shall follow on.<br />
We, free from cares the world affords,<br />
May chant the praise that is our Lord’s.<br />
 <br />
* All laud to God the Father be,<br />
All praise, Eternal Son, to thee:<br />
All glory, as is ever meet,<br />
To God the holy Paraclete.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">93:1</span>  The Lord is the God to whom revenge belongeth: * the God of revenge hath acted freely.<br />
<span class="w">93:2</span>  Lift up thyself, thou that judgest the earth: * render a reward to the proud.<br />
<span class="w">93:3</span>  How long shall sinners, O Lord: * how long shall sinners glory?<br />
<span class="w">93:4</span>  Shall they utter, and speak iniquity: * shall all speak who work injustice?<br />
<span class="w">93:5</span>  Thy people, O Lord, they have brought low: * and they have afflicted thy inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">93:6</span>  They have slain the widow and the stranger: * and they have murdered the fatherless.<br />
<span class="w">93:7</span>  And they have said: The Lord shall not see: * neither shall the God of Jacob understand.<br />
<span class="w">93:8</span>  Understand, ye senseless among the people: * and, you fools, be wise at last.<br />
<span class="w">93:9</span>  He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? * or he that formed the eye, doth he not consider?<br />
<span class="w">93:10</span>  He that chastiseth nations, shall he not rebuke: * he that teacheth man knowledge?<br />
<span class="w">93:11</span>  The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, * that they are vain.<br />

<span class="w">93:13</span>  That thou mayst give him rest from the evil days: * till a pit be dug for the wicked.<br />
<span class="w">93:14</span>  For the Lord will not cast off his people: * neither will he forsake his own inheritance.<br />
<span class="w">93:15</span>  Until justice be turned into judgment: * and they that are near it are all the upright in heart.<br />
<span class="w">93:16</span>  Who shall rise up for me against the evildoers? * or who shall stand with me against the workers of iniquity?<br />
<span class="w">93:17</span>  Unless the Lord had been my helper, * my soul had almost dwelt in hell.<br />
<span class="w">93:18</span>  If I said: My foot is moved: * thy mercy, O Lord, assisted me.<br />
<span class="w">93:19</span>  According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, * thy comforts have given joy to my soul.<br />
<span class="w">93:20</span>  Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee, * who framest labour in commandment?<br />
<span class="w">93:21</span>  They will hunt after the soul of the just, * and will condemn innocent blood.<br />
<span class="w">93:22</span>  But the Lord is my refuge: * and my God the help of my hope.<br />

<span class="w">107:3</span>  Arise, my glory; arise, psaltery and harp * I will arise in the morning early.<br />
<span class="w">107:4</span>  I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: * and I will sing unto thee among the nations.<br />
<span class="w">107:5</span>  For thy mercy is great above the heavens: * and thy truth even unto the clouds.<br />
<span class="w">107:6</span>  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory over all the earth: * that thy beloved may be delivered.<br />
<span class="w">107:7</span>  Save with thy right hand and hear me. * God hath spoken in his holiness.<br />
<span class="w">107:8</span>  I will rejoice, and I will divide Sichem * and I will mete out the vale of tabernacles.<br />

<span class="w">107:10</span>  Juda is my king: * Moab the pot of my hope.<br />
<span class="w">107:10</span>  Over Edom I will stretch out my shoe: * the aliens are become my friends.<br />
<span class="w">107:11</span>  Who will bring me into the strong city? * who will lead me into Edom?<br />
<span class="w">107:12</span>  Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? * and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our armies?<br />
<span class="w">107:13</span>  O grant us help from trouble: * for vain is the help of man.<br />
<span class="w">107:14</span>  Through God we shall do mightily: * and he will bring our enemies to nothing.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
