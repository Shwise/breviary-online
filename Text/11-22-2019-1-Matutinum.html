<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">S</i>on of a virgin, maker of thy mother,<br />
Thou, rod and blossom from a stem unstainèd,<br />
Now while a virgin fair of fame we honour,<br />
Hear our devotion!<br />
 <br />
Lo, on thy handmaid fell a two-fold blessing,<br />
Who, in her body vanquishing the weakness,<br />
In that same body, grace from heaven obtaining,<br />
Bore the world witness.<br />
 <br />
Death, nor the rending pains of death appalled her;<br />
Bondage and torment found her undefeated:<br />
So by the shedding of her blood attained she<br />
Heavenly guerdon.<br />
 <br />
Fountain of mercy, hear the prayers she offers;<br />
Purge our offences, pardon our transgressions,<br />
So that hereafter we to thee may render<br />
Praise with thanksgiving.<br />
 <br />
Thou, the All-Father, thou, the One-Begotten,<br />
Thou, Holy Spirit, Three in One co-equal,<br />
Glory be henceforth thine through all the ages,<br />
World without ending.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">8:2</span>  For thy magnificence is elevated * above the heavens.<br />
<span class="w">8:3</span>  Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise, because of thy enemies, * that thou mayst destroy the enemy and the avenger.<br />
<span class="w">8:4</span>  For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: * the moon and the stars which thou hast founded.<br />
<span class="w">8:5</span>  What is man that thou art mindful of him? * or the son of man that thou visitest him?<br />
<span class="w">8:6</span>  Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour: * and hast set him over the works of thy hands.<br />
<span class="w">8:8</span>  Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, * all sheep and oxen: moreover the beasts also of the fields.<br />
<span class="w">8:9</span>  The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, * that pass through the paths of the sea.<br />
<span class="w">8:10</span>  O Lord our Lord, * how admirable is thy name in all the earth!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">44:8</span>  Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: * therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br />
<span class="w">44:9</span>  Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: * out of which the daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory.<br />

Lesson from the first letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians<br />
<span class="ri">1 Cor 7:25-31</span><br />
<span class="w">25</span> Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.<br />
<span class="w">26</span> I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity, that it is good for a man so to be.<br />
<span class="w">27</span> Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.<br />
<span class="w">28</span> But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.<br />
<span class="w">29</span> This therefore I say, brethren; the time is short; it remaineth, that they also who have wives, be as if they had none;<br />
<span class="w">30</span> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;<br />
<span class="w">31</span> And they that use this world, as if they used it not: for the fashion of this world passeth away.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The musicians played, and the maiden Cecilia sang in her heart unto the Lord alone, saying:<br />
* Lord, let my heart and my body be undefiled, that I be not ashamed.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> She fasted and prayed for two days and three days together, committing the cause of her fear unto the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Lord, let my heart and my body be undefiled, that I be not ashamed.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>She whose feast-day we are keeping, be our Advocate with God. Amen <br />

<span class="ri">1 Cor 7:32-35</span><br />
<span class="w">32</span> But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife, is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please God.<br />
<span class="w">33</span> But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided.<br />
<span class="w">34</span> And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world, how she may please her husband.<br />
<span class="w">35</span> And this I speak for your profit: not to cast a snare upon you; but for that which is decent, and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.<br />
<span class="ri">1 Cor 7:36-40</span><br />
<span class="w">36</span> But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured, with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will; he sinneth not, if she marry.<br />
<span class="w">37</span> For he that hath determined being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will; and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.<br />
<span class="w">38</span> Therefore, both he that giveth his virgin in marriage, doth well; and he that giveth her not, doth better.<br />
<span class="w">39</span> A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband die, she is at liberty: let her marry to whom she will; only in the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">40</span> But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel; and I think that I also have the spirit of God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The glorious maiden carried the Gospel of Christ always in her breast, and meditated therein day and night,<br />
* Talking with God and praying.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> She spread forth her hands and prayed unto the Lord, and her heart was enkindled with fire from heaven.<br />

Cecilia, a Roman virgin of noble birth, vowed her virginity to God at a very early age. Given in marriage against her will to Valerian, she persuaded him to leave her untouched and go to blessed Urban, the Pope, that when he had been baptized he might be worthy to see Cecilia's angelic protector. When Valerian had obtained this favor, he converted his brother Tiburtius to Christ, and a little later both were martyred under the prefect Almachius. But Cecilia was seized by the same prefect because she had distributed the two brothers' wealth to the poor, and orders were given to have her suffocated in a bath. When the heat dared not harm her, she was struck three times with an axe, and left half dead. After three days she received the palm of virginity and of martyrdom, and was buried in the cemetery of Callistus. Her body and those of Popes Urban and Lucius, and of Tiburtius, Valerian and Maximus were transferred by Pope Paschal I to the church in the City dedicated to St. Cecilia.<br />
