<b>Psalms</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> May my request * come before thee, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 87</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">87:2</span>  Lord, the God of my salvation: * I have cried in the day, and in the night before thee.<br />
<span class="w">87:3</span>  Let my prayer come in before thee: * incline thy ear to my petition.<br />
<span class="w">87:4</span>  For my soul is filled with evils: * and my life hath drawn nigh to hell.<br />
<span class="w">87:5</span>  I am counted among them that go down to the pit: * I am become as a man without help, free among the dead.<br />
<span class="w">87:6</span>  Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres, whom thou rememberest no more: * and they are cast off from thy hand.<br />
<span class="w">87:7</span>  They have laid me in the lower pit: * in the dark places, and in the shadow of death.<br />
<span class="w">87:8</span>  Thy wrath is strong over me: * and all thy waves thou hast brought in upon me.<br />
<span class="w">87:9</span>  Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me: * they have set me an abomination to themselves.<br />
<span class="w">87:9</span>  I was delivered up, and came not forth: * my eyes languished through poverty.<br />
<span class="w">87:10</span>  All the day I cried to thee, O Lord: * I stretched out my hands to thee.<br />
<span class="w">87:11</span>  Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? * or shall physicians raise to life, and give praise to thee?<br />
<span class="w">87:12</span>  Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy: * and thy truth in destruction?<br />
<span class="w">87:13</span>  Shall thy wonders be known in the dark; * and thy justice in the land of forgetfulness?<br />
<span class="w">87:14</span>  But I, O Lord, have cried to thee: * and in the morning my prayer shall prevent thee.<br />
<span class="w">87:15</span>  Lord, why castest thou off my prayer: * why turnest thou away thy face from me?<br />
<span class="w">87:16</span>  I am poor, and in labours from my youth: * and being exalted have been humbled and troubled.<br />
<span class="w">87:17</span>  Thy wrath hath come upon me: * and thy terrors have troubled me.<br />
<span class="w">87:18</span>  They have come round about me like water all the day: * they have compassed me about together.<br />
<span class="w">87:19</span>  Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me: * and my acquaintance, because of misery.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="w">102:2</span>  Bless the Lord, O my soul, * and never forget all he hath done for thee.<br />
<span class="w">102:3</span>  Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: * who healeth all thy diseases.<br />
<span class="w">102:4</span>  Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: * who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.<br />
<span class="w">102:5</span>  Who satisfieth thy desire with good things: * thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle’s.<br />
<span class="w">102:6</span>  The Lord doth mercies, * and judgment for all that suffer wrong.<br />
<span class="w">102:7</span>  He hath made his ways known to Moses: * his wills to the children of Israel.<br />
<span class="w">102:8</span>  The Lord is compassionate and merciful: * longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.<br />
<span class="w">102:9</span>  He will not always be angry: * nor will he threaten for ever.<br />
<span class="w">102:10</span>  He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: * nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">102:11</span>  For according to the height of the heaven above the earth: * he hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">102:12</span>  As far as the east is from the west, * so far hath he removed our iniquities from us.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">102:13</span>  As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear him: * for he knoweth our frame.<br />
<span class="w">102:14</span>  He remembereth that we are dust: * man’s days are as grass, as the flower of the field so shall he flourish.<br />
<span class="w">102:16</span>  For the spirit shall pass in him, and he shall not be: * and he shall know his place no more.<br />
<span class="w">102:17</span>  But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity * and unto eternity upon them that fear him:<br />
<span class="w">102:17</span>  And his justice unto children’s children, * to such as keep his covenant,<br />
<span class="w">102:18</span>  And are mindful of his commandments * to do them.<br />
<span class="w">102:19</span>  The Lord hath prepared his throne in heaven: * and his kingdom shall rule over all.<br />
<span class="w">102:20</span>  Bless the Lord, all ye his angels: * you that are mighty in strength, and execute his word, hearkening to the voice of his orders.<br />
<span class="w">102:21</span>  Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts: * you ministers of his that do his will.<br />
<span class="w">102:22</span>  Bless the Lord, all his works: * in every place of his dominion, O my soul, bless thou the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> May my request come before thee, O Lord.<br />

Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
