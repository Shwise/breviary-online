<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">O</i> sovereign Lord of nature’s might, <br />
Who bad’st the water’s birth divide;<br />
Part in the heavens to take their flight,<br />
And part in ocean’s deep to hide; <br />
 <br />
These low obscured, on airy wing <br />
Exalted those, that either race, <br />
Though from one element they spring,<br />
Might serve thee in a different place.<br />
 <br />
Grant, Lord, that we thy servants all,<br />
Saved by thy tide of cleansing blood,<br />
No more ’neath sin's dominion fall,<br />
Nor fear the thought of death’s dark flood!<br />
 <br />
Thy varied love each spirit bless, <br />
The humble cheer, the high control;<br />
Check in each heart its proud excess,<br />
But raise the meek and contrite soul!<br />
 <br />
This boon, O Father, we entreat,<br />
This blessing grant, Eternal Son,<br />
And Holy Ghost, the Paraclete,<br />
Both now, and while the ages run.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> O Lord, direct my prayer.<br />
