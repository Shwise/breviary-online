<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>h' eternal gifts of Christ the King,<br />
The Apostles' glory, let us sing;<br />
And all with hearts of gladness raise<br />
Due hymns of thankful love and praise.<br />
 <br />
For they the Church's princes are,<br />
Triumphant leaders in the war,<br />
The heavenly King's own warrior band,<br />
True lights to lighten every land.<br />
 <br />
Theirs was the steadfast faith of saints,<br />
The hope that never yields nor faints,<br />
The love of Christ in perfect glow,<br />
That lay the prince of this world low.<br />
 <br />
In them the Father's glory shone,<br />
In them the Spirit's will was done,<br />
The Son himself exults in them;<br />
Joy fills the new Jerusalem.<br />
 <br />
* Praise to the Father, with the Son,<br />
And Holy Spirit, Three in One;<br />
As ever was in ages past,<br />
And so shall be while ages last.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord saw Peter and Andrew, * and He called them.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 18</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">18:2</span>  The heavens shew forth the glory of God, * and the firmament declareth the work of his hands.<br />
<span class="w">18:3</span>  Day to day uttereth speech, * and night to night sheweth knowledge.<br />
<span class="w">18:4</span>  There are no speeches nor languages, * where their voices are not heard.<br />
<span class="w">18:5</span>  Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: * and their words unto the ends of the world.<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: * and he, as a bridegroom coming out of his bride chamber,<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,<br />
<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">18:9</span>  The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">18:10</span>  The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.<br />
<span class="w">18:11</span>  More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br />
<span class="w">18:12</span>  For thy servant keepeth them, * and in keeping them there is a great reward.<br />
<span class="w">18:13</span>  Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: * and from those of others spare thy servant.<br />
<span class="w">18:14</span>  If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  O Lord, my helper, * and my redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">33:2</span>  I will bless the Lord at all times, * his praise shall be always in my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">33:3</span>  In the Lord shall my soul be praised: * let the meek hear and rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">33:4</span>  O magnify the Lord with me; * and let us extol his name together.<br />

<span class="w">33:6</span>  Come ye to him and be enlightened: * and your faces shall not be confounded.<br />
<span class="w">33:7</span>  This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him: * and saved him out of all his troubles.<br />
<span class="w">33:8</span>  The Angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him: * and shall deliver them.<br />
<span class="w">33:9</span>  O taste, and see that the Lord is sweet: * blessed is the man that hopeth in him.<br />
<span class="w">33:10</span>  Fear the Lord, all ye his saints: * for there is no want to them that fear him.<br />
<span class="w">33:11</span>  The rich have wanted, and have suffered hunger: * but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good.<br />
<span class="w">33:12</span>  Come, children, hearken to me: * I will teach you the fear of the Lord.<br />
<span class="w">33:13</span>  Who is the man that desireth life: * who loveth to see good days?<br />
<span class="w">33:14</span>  Keep thy tongue from evil, * and thy lips from speaking guile.<br />
<span class="w">33:15</span>  Turn away from evil and do good: * seek after peace and pursue it.<br />
<span class="w">33:16</span>  The eyes of the Lord are upon the just: * and his ears unto their prayers.<br />
<span class="w">33:17</span>  But the countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil things: * to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.<br />
<span class="w">33:18</span>  The just cried, and the Lord heard them: * and delivered them out of all their troubles.<br />
<span class="w">33:19</span>  The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: * and he will save the humble of spirit.<br />
<span class="w">33:20</span>  Many are the afflictions of the just; * but out of them all will the Lord deliver them.<br />
<span class="w">33:21</span>  The Lord keepeth all their bones, * not one of them shall be broken.<br />
<span class="w">33:22</span>  The death of the wicked is very evil: * and they that hate the just shall be guilty.<br />
<span class="w">33:23</span>  The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants: * and none of them that trust in him shall offend.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

Lesson from the letter of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans<br />
<span class="ri">Rom 10:4-9</span><br />
<span class="w">4</span> For the end of the law is Christ, unto justice to every one that believeth.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> For Moses wrote, that the justice which is of the law, the man that shall do it, shall live by it.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus: Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down;<br />
<span class="w">7</span> Or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> But what saith the scripture? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart. This is the word of faith, which we preach.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Lord, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw Peter and Andrew casting their nets into the sea, and He called them saying:<br />
* Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For they were fishers, and He saith unto them:<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Son, the Sole-begotten, mercifully bless and keep us. Amen. <br />
 <br />
<b>Reading 2</b><br />
<span class="ri">Rom 10:10-15</span><br />
<span class="w">10</span> For, with the heart, we believe unto justice; but, with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.<br />
<span class="w">11</span> For the scripture saith: Whosoever believeth in him, shall not be confounded.<br />
<span class="w">12</span> For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for the same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him.<br />
<span class="w">13</span> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.<br />
<span class="w">14</span> How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear, without a preacher?<br />
<span class="w">15</span> And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is written: How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of them that bring glad tidings of good things!<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As soon as the blessed Andrew heard the voice of the Lord calling him, he left his nets, by the exercise and use whereof he lived;<br />
* And followed Him Who giveth life everlasting.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> This is that disciple who for the love of Christ hung upon the cross, and suffered for the law of his God.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And followed Him Who giveth life everlasting.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the grace of the  Holy Spirit enlighten all our hearts and minds. Amen. <br />

<span class="ri">Rom 10:16-21</span><br />
<span class="w">16</span> But all do not obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: Lord, who hath believed our report?<br />
<span class="w">17</span> Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ.<br />
<span class="w">18</span> But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily, their sound hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the whole world.<br />
<span class="w">19</span> But I say: Hath not Israel known? First, Moses saith: I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation; by a foolish nation I will anger you.<br />
<span class="w">20</span> But Isaias is bold, and saith: I was found by them that did not seek me: I appeared openly to them that asked not after me.<br />
<span class="w">21</span> But to Israel he saith: All the day long have I spread my hands to a people that believeth not, and contradicteth me.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

The Apostle Andrew was born at Bethsaida, a town of Galilee, and was the brother of Peter. He was a disciple of John the Baptist, and heard him say of Christ, Behold the Lamb of God, <span class="w">John i. 35-37, 40,</span> whereupon he immediately followed Jesus, bringing his brother also with him. Some while after, they were both fishing in the Sea of Galilee, and the Lord Christ, going by, called them both, before any other of the Apostles, in the words, Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men. They made no delay, but left their nets, and followed Him. <span class="w">Matth. iv. 18-20.</span> After the death and Resurrection of Christ, Andrew was allotted Scythia as the province of his preaching, and, after labouring there, he went through Epirus and Thrace, where he turned vast multitudes to Christ by his teaching and miracles. Finally he went to Patras in Achaia, and there also he brought many to the knowledge of Gospel truth. Aegeas the Pro-consul resisted the preaching of the Gospel, and the Apostle freely rebuked him, bidding him know that while he held himself a judge of his fellow men, he was himself hindered by devils from knowing Christ our God, the Judge of all.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The man of God was led to be crucified, and the people cried with a loud voice, saying:<br />
* The innocent blood of this just person is condemned without a cause.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And when they led him out to crucify him, all the people ran together and cried, saying<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The innocent blood of this just person is condemned without a cause.<br />

<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May Christ to all His people give, for ever in His sight to live. Amen.<br />

Then Egeas, being angry, answered him, Boast no more of this thy Christ. He spake words even such as thine, but they availed Him not, and He was crucified by the Jews. Whereto Andrew boldly answered that Christ had given Himself up to die for man's salvation; but the Pro-consul blasphemously interrupted him, and bade him look to himself, and sacrifice to the gods. Then said Andrew, We have an altar, whereon day by day I offer up to God, the Almighty, the One, and the True, not the flesh of bulls nor the blood of goats, but a Lamb without spot and when all they that believe have eaten of the Flesh Thereof, the Lamb That was slain abideth whole and liveth. Then Aegeas being filled with wrath, bound the Apostle in prison. Now, the people would have delivered him, but he himself calmed the multitude, and earnestly besought them not to take away from him the crown of martyrdom, for which he longed and which was now drawing near.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

<span class="ri">V.</span> The blessed Andrew stretched forth his hands to heaven and prayed, saying: Precious cross, be my salvation,<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> That, as by thee He redeemed me, so by thee also He may take me unto Himself.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />

Come a short while after, he was brought before the judgment-seat, where he extolled the mystery of the cross, and rebuked Aegeas for his ungodliness. Then Aegeas could bear with him no longer, but commanded him to be crucified, in imitation of Christ. Andrew, then, was led to the place of martyrdom, and, as soon as he came in sight of the cross, he cried out, O precious cross, which the Members of my Lord have made so goodly, how long have I desired thee! how warmly have I loved thee! how constantly have I sought thee! And, now that thou art come to me, how is my soul drawn to thee! Welcome me from among men, and join me again to my Master, that as by thee He redeemed me, so by thee also He may take me unto Himself. So he was fastened to the cross, whereon he hung living for two days, during which time he ceased not to preach the faith of Christ, and, finally, passed into the Presence of Him the likeness of Whose death he had loved so well. All the above particulars of his last sufferings were written by the Priests and Deacons of Achaia, who bear witness to them of their own knowledge. Under the Emperor Constantine the bones of the Apostle were first taken to Constantinople, whence they were afterwards brought to Amalfi. In the Pontificate of Pope Pius II his head was carried to Rome, where it is kept in the Basilica of St. Peter.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 4:18-22</span><br />
At that time, Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers). And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by Pope St. Gregory <span class="w">the Great.</span><br />
<span class="ri">5th on the Gospels.</span><br />
Dearly beloved brethren, ye hear how that Peter and Andrew, having once heard the Lord call them, left their nets, and followed their Saviour. As yet they had seen none of His miracles, as yet they had received no promise of their exceeding and eternal reward; nevertheless, at one word of the Lord they forgot all those things which they seemed to have. We have seen many of His miracles; we have received many of His gracious chastenings; many times hath He warned us of the wrath to come and yet Christ calleth and we do not follow.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The holy Andrew lifted up his eyes to heaven, and prayed, and cried with a loud voice, and said: Thou art my God, Whom I have seen; suffer not the unjust judge to take me down from the cross<br />
* For now I know what the power of thy holy Cross is.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Thou art Christ my Master, Whom I have loved, Whom I have known, Whom I have confessed in this thing hear me.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For now I know what the power of thy holy Cross is.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>He whose feast-day we are keeping, be our Advocate with God. Amen. <br />

He who calleth us to be converted is now enthroned in heaven; He hath broken the necks of the Gentiles to the yoke of the faith, He hath laid low the glory of the world, and the wrecks thereof, falling ever more and more to decay, do preach unto us that the coming of that day when He is to be revealed as our Judge is drawing nigh and yet, so stubborn is our mind, that we will not yet freely abandon that which, will we, nill we, we lose day by day. Dearly beloved brethren, what shall we answer at His judgment-seat, we whom no lessons can persuade, and no stripes can break of the love of this present world?<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> When Andrew saw the cross he cried, saying: How wonderful art thou, O cross! O cross, how loveable art thou! O cross, thy bright beams enlighten the darkness of the whole world!<br />

<b>Reading 9</b><br />
Perhaps one perchance will ask in his heart, what Peter or Andrew had to lose by obeying the call of the Lord? Dearly beloved brethren, we must consider here rather the intention than the loss incurred by this obedience. He that keepeth nothing for himself, giveth up much; he that sacrificeth his all, sacrificed! what is to him a great deal. Beyond doubt, we cling to whatever we have, and what we have least, that we desire most. Peter and Andrew therefore gave up much when they gave up even the desire of possessing anything.<br />
