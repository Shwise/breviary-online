<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">C</i>elestial Word, to this our earth<br />
Sent down from God's eternal clime,<br />
To save mankind by mortal birth <br />
Into a world of change and time;<br />
 <br />
Enlighten our hearts; vain hopes destroy;<br />
And in thy love's consuming fire <br />
Fill all the soul with heavenly joy, <br />
And melt the dross of low desire.<br />
 <br />
So when the Judge of quick and dead<br />
Shall bid his awful summons come,<br />
To whelm the guilty soul with dread,<br />
And call the blessed to their home.<br />
 <br />
Saved from the whirling, black abyss,<br />
Forevermore to us be given <br />
To share the feast of saintly bliss, <br />
And see the face of God in heaven.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father and the Son <br />
Our songs with one accord we raise;<br />
And to the Holy Spirit, One <br />
With them, be ever equal praise<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">9:23</span>  Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: * they are caught in the counsels which they devise.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> The Angel Gabriel was sent to Mary, a Virgin espoused to Joseph, to bring unto her the word of the Lord, and when the Virgin saw the light, she was afraid. Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace from the Lord.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
From the Holy Gospel according to Luke<br />
<span class="ri">Luke 21:25-33</span><br />
In that time, Jesus said to his disciples: And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by Pope St. Gregory <span class="w">the Great,</span><br />
<span class="ri">1st on the Gospels.</span><br />
Our Lord and Saviour wisheth to find us ready at His second coming. Therefore He telleth us what will be the evils of the world as it groweth old, that He may wean our hearts from worldly affections. Here we read what great convulsions will go before the end, that, if we will not fear God in our prosperity, we may at least be scourged into fearing His judgment when it is at hand.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch; and a King shall reign in wisdom and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth:<br />
* And this is His name whereby He shall be called: * The Lord our Righteous one.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And this is His name whereby He shall be called.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Lord our Righteous one.<br />
