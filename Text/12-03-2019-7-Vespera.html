<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Sir 31:8-9</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>lessed is the rich man that is found without blemish: and that hath not gone after gold, nor put his trust in money nor in treasures. Who is he, and we will praise him? for he hath done wonderful things in his life.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">T</i>his the confessor of the Lord, whose triumph<br />
Now all the faithful celebrate, with gladness<br />
On this feast day year by year receiveth<br />
Merited honors.<br />
 <br />
Saintly and prudent, modest in behaviour,<br />
Peaceful and sober, chaste was he, and lowly.<br />
While that life’s vigour, coursing through his members,<br />
Quickened his being.<br />
 <br />
Sick ones of old time, to his tomb resorting,<br />
Sorely by ailments manifold afflicted,<br />
Oft-times have welcomed health and strength returning,<br />
At his petition.<br />
 <br />
Whence we in chorus gladly do him honour,<br />
Chanting his praises with devout affection,<br />
That in his merits we may have a portion,<br />
Now and forever.<br />
 <br />
His be the glory, power and salvation,<br />
Who over all things reigneth in the highest,<br />
Earth’s mighty fabric ruling and directing,<br />
Onely and Trinal.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The Lord guided the just in right paths.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And showed him the kingdom of God.<br />
