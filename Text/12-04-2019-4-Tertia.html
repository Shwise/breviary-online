<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">C</i>ome Holy Ghost, who ever One<br />
Art with the Father and the Son,<br />
It is the hour, our souls possess<br />
With thy full flood of holiness.<br />

Let flesh and heart and lips and mind<br />
Sound forth our witness to mankind;<br />
And love light up our mortal frame,<br />
Till others catch the living flame.<br />

Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />
<b>Psalms</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> For behold God is my helper: * and the Lord is the protector of my soul.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 53</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">53:3</span>  Save me, O God, by thy name, * and judge me in thy strength.<br />
<span class="w">53:4</span>  O God, hear my prayer: * give ear to the words of my mouth.<br />
<span class="w">53:5</span>  For strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul: * and they have not set God before their eyes.<br />
<span class="w">53:6</span>  For behold God is my helper: * and the Lord is the protector of my soul.<br />
<span class="w">53:7</span>  Turn back the evils upon my enemies; * and cut them off in thy truth.<br />
<span class="w">53:8</span>  I will freely sacrifice to thee, * and will give praise, O God, to thy name: because it is good:<br />
<span class="w">53:9</span>  For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble: * and my eye hath looked down upon my enemies.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 54(2-16)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">54:2</span>  Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not my supplication: * be attentive to me and hear me.<br />
<span class="w">54:3</span>  I am grieved in my exercise; * and am troubled, at the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner.<br />
<span class="w">54:4</span>  For they have cast iniquities upon me; * and in wrath they were troublesome to me.<br />
<span class="w">54:5</span>  My heart is troubled within me: * and the fear of death is fallen upon me.<br />
<span class="w">54:6</span>  Fear and trembling are come upon me: * and darkness hath covered me.<br />
<span class="w">54:7</span>  And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, * and I will fly and be at rest?<br />
<span class="w">54:8</span>  Lo, I have gone far off flying away; * and I abode in the wilderness.<br />
<span class="w">54:9</span>  I waited for him that hath saved me * from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.<br />
<span class="w">54:10</span>  Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; * for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.<br />
<span class="w">54:11</span>  Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: * and in the midst thereof are labour, and injustice.<br />
<span class="w">54:12</span>  And usury and deceit * have not departed from its streets.<br />
<span class="w">54:13</span>  For if my enemy had reviled me, * I would verily have borne with it.<br />
<span class="w">54:13</span>  And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, * I would perhaps have hidden myself from him.<br />
<span class="w">54:14</span>  But thou a man of one mind, * my guide, and my familiar.<br />
<span class="w">54:15</span>  Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: * in the house of God we walked with consent.<br />
<span class="w">54:16</span>  Let death come upon them, * and let them go down alive into hell.<br />
<span class="w">54:16</span>  For there is wickedness in their dwellings: * in the midst of them.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 54(17-24)</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">54:17</span>  But I have cried to God: * and the Lord will save me.<br />
<span class="w">54:18</span>  Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: * and he shall hear my voice.<br />
<span class="w">54:19</span>  He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: * for among many they were with me.<br />
<span class="w">54:20</span>  God shall hear, * and the Eternal shall humble them.<br />
<span class="w">54:20</span>  For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God: * he hath stretched forth his hand to repay.<br />
<span class="w">54:21</span>  They have defiled his covenant, they are divided by the wrath of his countenance, * and his heart hath drawn near.<br />
<span class="w">54:22</span>  His words are smoother than oil, * and the same are darts.<br />
<span class="w">54:23</span>  Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: * he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.<br />
<span class="w">54:24</span>  But thou, O God, shalt bring them down * into the pit of destruction.<br />
<span class="w">54:24</span>  Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; * but I will trust in thee, O Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> For behold God is my helper: and the Lord is the protector of my soul.<br />
