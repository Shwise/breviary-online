<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">B</i>lest guardian of all virgin souls,<br />
Portal of bliss to man forgiven,<br />
Pure Mother of Almighty God,<br />
Thou hope of earth and joy of heaven!<br />
 <br />
Fair Lily found among the thorn,<br />
Most beauteous Dove with wings of gold,<br />
Rod from whose tender root upsprang<br />
That healing Flower so long foretold<br />
 <br />
Thou Tower against the dragon proof,<br />
Thou Star to stormtossed voyagers dear;<br />
Our course lies o'er a treacherous deep,<br />
thine be the light by which we steer.<br />
 <br />
Scatter the mists that round us hang;<br />
Keep far the fatal shoals away;<br />
And while through darkling waves we sweep,<br />
Open a path to light and day.<br />
 <br />
O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,<br />
Immortal glory be to thee;<br />
Praise to the Father infinite<br />
And Holy Ghost eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Gen 3:1-5</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?<br />
<span class="w">2</span> And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:<br />
<span class="w">3</span> But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.<br />

<span class="w">7</span> And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.<br />

<b>Reading 4</b><br />
From the Sermons of St. Jerome, Priest <span class="w">at Bethlehem.</span><br />
<span class="ri">On the Assumption</span><br />
Who and what was the blessed and glorious Mary, always a Virgin, hath been revealed by God by the message of an Angel, in these words: Hail, thou that art full of grace, the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women. It was fitting that a fullness of grace should be poured into that Virgin who hath given to God glory and to man a Saviour, who hath brought peace to earth, who hath given faith to the Gentiles, who hath killed sin, who hath given law to life, who hath made the crooked ways straight. Verily, she is full of grace. To others grace cometh measure by measure; in Mary grace dwelleth at once in all fullness. Verily, she is full of grace. We believe that the holy Fathers and Prophets had grace; but they were not full of grace. But into Mary came a fullness of all the grace which is in Christ, albeit otherwise than as it is in Him. Therefore is it said: Blessed art thou among women, that is, Blessed art thou above all women. The fulness of blessing in Mary utterly neutralized in her any effects of the curse of Eve. In her praise Solomon writeth in the Song of Songs, <span class="w">ii. 10,</span>: Rise up, my dove, my fair one, for the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. And again: Come from Lebanon, my Spouse, come, thou shalt be crowned. <span class="w">iv. 8.</span><br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />

Not unjustly then is she bidden to come from Lebanon, for Lebanon is so named on account of its stainless and glistening whiteness. The earthly Lebanon is white with snow, but the lonely heights of Mary's holiness are white with purity and grace, brilliantly fair, whiter far than snow, sparkling with the gifts of the Holy Ghost she is undefiled like a dove, all clean, all upright, full of grace and truth. She is full of mercy, and of the righteousness that hath looked down from heaven, and therefore is she without stain because in her hath never been any corruption. She hath compassed a man in her womb, saith holy Jeremiah, but she conceived not by the will of fallen man. The Lord, saith the Prophet, hath created a new thing in the earth; a woman shall compass a man. <span class="w">xxxi. 22.</span> Verily, it is a new thing. Verily, it was a new work of power, greater than all other works, when God, Whom the world cannot bear, and Whom no man shall see and live, entered the lodging of her womb, breaking not the blissful cloister of her virgin flesh. And in her body He was borne, the Infinite inclosed within her womb. And from her womb He came forth, so that it was fulfilled which was spoken of the Prophet Ezekiel, saying: This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. <span class="w">xliv. 2.</span> Hence also in the Song of Songs it is said of her <span class="w">iv. 12,</span>: A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse, a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed, thy perfumes are a garden of delights. Verily a garden of delights, filled with the perfumes of all flowers, rich with the sweet savour of grace. And the most holy Virgin herself is a garden enclosed, whereinto sin and Satan have never entered to sully the blossoms, a fountain sealed, sealed with the seal of the Trinity.<br />

From the acts of Pope Pius IX<br />
 <br />
The fact that the Virgin Mother of God had at the moment of her conception triumphed over the foul enemy of man, hath ever been borne out by the Holy Scriptures, by the venerable tradition of the Church, and by her unceasing belief, as well as by the common conviction of all Bishops and faithful Catholics, and by marked acts and constitutions of the Holy See. At length the Supreme Pontiff Pius IX, in compliance with the wishes of the Universal Church, determined to publish it as a truth of faith, on his own absolute and unerring authority, and accordingly, on the 8th day of December, 1854, in the Vatican Basilica, in presence of a great multitude composed of the Fathers Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, and Bishops from all parts of the earth, he, with the consent and jubilation of the whole world, declared and defined as follows That doctrine which declareth that the most blessed Virgin Mary was in the first instant of her Conception preserved, by a special privilege granted unto her by God, from any stain of original sin, is a doctrine taught and revealed by God, and therefore is to be held by all faithful Christians firmly and constantly.<br />
