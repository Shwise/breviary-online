<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Prov 8:22-24</span><br />
<i class="a">T</i>he Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made any thing from the beginning. I was set up from eternity, and of old before the earth was made. The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<span class="ri">The first verse of the following hymn is said genuflecting.</span><br />
<i class="a">A</i>ve, star of ocean,<br />
Child divine who barest,<br />
Mother, ever-Virgin,<br />
Heaven's portal fairest.<br />
 <br />
Taking that sweet Ave<br />
Erst by Gabriel spoken,<br />
Eva's name reversing,<br />
Be of peace the token.<br />
 <br />
Break the sinners' fetters,<br />
Light to blind restoring,<br />
All our ills dispelling,<br />
Every boon imploring.<br />
 <br />
Show thyself a mother<br />
In thy supplication;<br />
He will hear who chose thee<br />
At his incarnation.<br />
 <br />
Maid all maids excelling,<br />
Passing meek and lowly,<br />
Win for sinners pardon,<br />
Make us chaste and holy.<br />
 <br />
As we onward journey<br />
Aid our weak endeavour,<br />
Till we gaze on Jesus<br />
And rejoice forever.<br />
 <br />
Father, Son, and Spirit,<br />
Three in One confessing,<br />
Give we equal glory<br />
Equal praise and blessing.<br />
Amen.<br />
