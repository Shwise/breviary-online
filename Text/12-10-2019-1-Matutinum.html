<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">C</i>elestial Word, to this our earth<br />
Sent down from God's eternal clime,<br />
To save mankind by mortal birth <br />
Into a world of change and time;<br />
 <br />
Enlighten our hearts; vain hopes destroy;<br />
And in thy love's consuming fire <br />
Fill all the soul with heavenly joy, <br />
And melt the dross of low desire.<br />
 <br />
So when the Judge of quick and dead<br />
Shall bid his awful summons come,<br />
To whelm the guilty soul with dread,<br />
And call the blessed to their home.<br />
 <br />
Saved from the whirling, black abyss,<br />
Forevermore to us be given <br />
To share the feast of saintly bliss, <br />
And see the face of God in heaven.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father and the Son <br />
Our songs with one accord we raise;<br />
And to the Holy Spirit, One <br />
With them, be ever equal praise<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 34(1-10)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">34:1</span>  Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: * overthrow them that fight against me.<br />
<span class="w">34:2</span>  Take hold of arms and shield: * and rise up to help me.<br />
<span class="w">34:3</span>  Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: * say to my soul: I am thy salvation.<br />
<span class="w">34:4</span>  Let them be confounded and ashamed * that seek after my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:4</span>  Let them be turned back and be confounded * that devise against me.<br />
<span class="w">34:5</span>  Let them become as dust before the wind: * and let the Angel of the Lord straiten them.<br />
<span class="w">34:6</span>  Let their way become dark and slippery; * and let the Angel of the Lord pursue them.<br />
<span class="w">34:7</span>  For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: * without cause they have upbraided my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:8</span>  Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: * and into that very snare let them fall.<br />
<span class="w">34:9</span>  But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; * and shall be delighted in his salvation.<br />
<span class="w">34:10</span>  All my bones shall say: * Lord, who is like to thee?<br />
<span class="w">34:10</span>  Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; * the needy and the poor from them that strip him.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Rescue, O Lord, * my soul from their malice.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 34(11-17)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">34:11</span>  Unjust witnesses rising up * have asked me things I knew not.<br />
<span class="w">34:12</span>  They repaid me evil for good: * to the depriving me of my soul.<br />
<span class="w">34:13</span>  But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, * I was clothed with haircloth.<br />
<span class="w">34:13</span>  I humbled my soul with fasting; * and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom.<br />
<span class="w">34:14</span>  As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: * as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.<br />
<span class="w">34:15</span>  But they rejoiced against me, and came together: * scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not.<br />
<span class="w">34:16</span>  They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: * they gnashed upon me with their teeth.<br />
<span class="w">34:17</span>  Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? * rescue thou my soul from their malice: my only one from the lions.<br />

<span class="w">34:18</span>  I will give thanks to thee in a great church; * I will praise thee in a strong people.<br />
<span class="w">34:19</span>  Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: * who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">34:20</span>  For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; * and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.<br />
<span class="w">34:21</span>  And they opened their mouth wide against me; * they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.<br />
<span class="w">34:22</span>  Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: * O Lord, depart not from me.<br />
<span class="w">34:23</span>  Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: * to my cause, my God, and my Lord.<br />
<span class="w">34:24</span>  Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, * and let them not rejoice over me.<br />
<span class="w">34:25</span>  Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our mind: * neither let them say: We have swallowed him up.<br />
<span class="w">34:26</span>  Let them blush: and be ashamed together, * who rejoice at my evils.<br />
<span class="w">34:26</span>  Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, * who speak great things against me.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Envy not * the man who prospereth in his way; the man who doth unjust things.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 36(1-15)</span><em> [4]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:1</span>  Be not emulous of evildoers; * nor envy them that work iniquity.<br />

<span class="w">36:4</span>  Delight in the Lord, * and he will give thee the requests of thy heart.<br />
<span class="w">36:5</span>  Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, * and he will do it.<br />
<span class="w">36:6</span>  And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday: * be subject to the Lord and pray to him.<br />
<span class="w">36:7</span>  Envy not the man who prospereth in his way; * the man who doth unjust things.<br />
<span class="w">36:8</span>  Cease from anger, and leave rage; * have no emulation to do evil.<br />
<span class="w">36:9</span>  For the evildoers shall be cut off: * but they that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the land.<br />
<span class="w">36:10</span>  For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: * and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.<br />
<span class="w">36:11</span>  But the meek shall inherit the land, * and shall delight in abundance of peace.<br />
<span class="w">36:12</span>  The sinner shall watch the just man: * and shall gnash upon him with his teeth.<br />
<span class="w">36:13</span>  But the Lord shall laugh at him: * for he foreseeth that his day shall come.<br />
<span class="w">36:14</span>  The wicked have drawn out the sword: * they have bent their bow.<br />
<span class="w">36:14</span>  To cast down the poor and needy, * to kill the upright of heart.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The arms of the wicked * shall be broken in pieces; but the Lord strengtheneth the just.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 36(16-29)</span><em> [5]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:16</span>  Better is a little to the just, * than the great riches of the wicked.<br />

<span class="w">36:19</span>  They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled, * because the wicked shall perish.<br />
<span class="w">36:20</span>  And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, * shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke.<br />
<span class="w">36:21</span>  The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; * but the just sheweth mercy and shall give.<br />
<span class="w">36:22</span>  For such as bless him shall inherit the land: * but such as curse him shall perish.<br />
<span class="w">36:23</span>  With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, * and he shall like well his way.<br />
<span class="w">36:24</span>  When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, * for the Lord putteth his hand under him.<br />
<span class="w">36:25</span>  I have been young, and now am old; * and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Keep innocence * and behold justice.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 36(30-40)</span><em> [6]</em><br />
<span class="w">36:30</span>  The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom: * and his tongue shall speak judgment.<br />
<span class="w">36:31</span>  The law of his God is in his heart, * and his steps shall not be supplanted.<br />
<span class="w">36:32</span>  The wicked watcheth the just man, * and seeketh to put him to death.<br />
<span class="w">36:33</span>  But the Lord will not leave him in his hands; * nor condemn him when he shall be judged.<br />
<span class="w">36:34</span>  Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: * when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.<br />
<span class="w">36:35</span>  I have seen the wicked highly exalted, * and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus.<br />
<span class="w">36:36</span>  And I passed by, and lo, he was not: * and I sought him and his place was not found.<br />
<span class="w">36:37</span>  Keep innocence, and behold justice: * for there are remnants for the peaceable man.<br />
<span class="w">36:38</span>  But the unjust shall be destroyed together: * the remnants of the wicked shall perish.<br />
<span class="w">36:39</span>  But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, * and he is their protector in the time of trouble.<br />
<span class="w">36:40</span>  And the Lord will help them and deliver them: * and he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them, because they have hoped in him.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> O Lord, * do not chastise me in thy wrath.<br />

<span class="w">37:2</span>  Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; * nor chastise me in thy wrath.<br />

<span class="w">37:4</span>  There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath: * there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.<br />

<span class="w">37:6</span>  My sores are putrified and corrupted, * because of my foolishness.<br />
<span class="w">37:7</span>  I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end: * I walked sorrowful all the day long.<br />

<span class="w">37:9</span>  I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: * I roared with the groaning of my heart.<br />
<span class="w">37:10</span>  Lord, all my desire is before thee, * and my groaning is not hidden from thee.<br />

<span class="w">37:14</span>  But I, as a deaf man, heard not: * and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.<br />
<span class="w">37:15</span>  And I became as a man that heareth not: * and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.<br />
<span class="w">37:16</span>  For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped: * thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.<br />
<span class="w">37:17</span>  For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me: * and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.<br />
<span class="w">37:18</span>  For I am ready for scourges: * and my sorrow is continually before me.<br />

<span class="w">37:21</span>  They that render evil for good, have detracted me, * because I followed goodness.<br />

<span class="w">2</span> And the people shall take them, and bring them into their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants and handmaids: and they shall make them captives that had taken them, and shall subdue their oppressors.<br />
