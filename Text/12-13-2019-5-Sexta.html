<i class="a">O</i> God of truth, O Lord of might,<br />
Who orderest time and change aright,<br />
Who send’st the early morning ray,<br />
And light’st the glow of perfect day:<br />

Extinguish thou each sinful fire,<br />
And banish every ill desire;<br />
And while thou keep’st the body whole,<br />
Shed forth thy peace upon the soul.<br />

Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
