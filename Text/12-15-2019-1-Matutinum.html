<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">C</i>elestial Word, to this our earth<br />
Sent down from God's eternal clime,<br />
To save mankind by mortal birth <br />
Into a world of change and time;<br />
 <br />
Enlighten our hearts; vain hopes destroy;<br />
And in thy love's consuming fire <br />
Fill all the soul with heavenly joy, <br />
And melt the dross of low desire.<br />
 <br />
So when the Judge of quick and dead<br />
Shall bid his awful summons come,<br />
To whelm the guilty soul with dread,<br />
And call the blessed to their home.<br />
 <br />
Saved from the whirling, black abyss,<br />
Forevermore to us be given <br />
To share the feast of saintly bliss, <br />
And see the face of God in heaven.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father and the Son <br />
Our songs with one accord we raise;<br />
And to the Holy Spirit, One <br />
With them, be ever equal praise<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">1:5</span>  Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: * nor sinners in the council of the just.<br />

<span class="w">9:23</span>  Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: * they are caught in the counsels which they devise.<br />
<span class="w">9:24</span>  For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: * and the unjust man is blessed.<br />
<span class="w">9:25</span>  The sinner hath provoked the Lord, * according to the multitude of his wrath he will not seek him.<br />
<span class="w">9:26</span>  God is not before his eyes: * his ways are filthy at all times.<br />

<span class="w">10:2</span>  In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: * Get thee away from hence to the mountain, like a sparrow?<br />
<span class="w">10:3</span>  For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow: they have prepared their arrows in the quiver, * to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.<br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
From the Holy Gospel according to John<br />
<span class="ri">John 1:19-28</span><br />
In that time were sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to John, to ask him: Who art thou? And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by Pope St. Gregory (the Great)<br />
<span class="ri">7th on the Gospels</span><br />
Dearly beloved brethren, the first thing which striketh us in today's Gospel is the lowly-mindedness of John. He was so great that it was thought he might be the Christ; yet he soberly chose rather to seem only what he really was, than to let the belief of men invest him with a dignity which did not belong to him; for he confessed, and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ, at the same time he would not deny what he was in reality; and thus his very truth-speaking made him a member of Him Whose title he would not by falsehood take. In that he arrogated not to himself the name of Christ, he became a member of Christ. While he humbly strove to confess his own weakness, he earned by his simplicity a part in the grandeur of his Master.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The Lord will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths.<br />
* For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<br />
