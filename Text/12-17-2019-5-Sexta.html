<b>Hymn</b> 
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> God of truth, O Lord of might,<br />
Who orderest time and change aright,<br />
Who send’st the early morning ray,<br />
And light’st the glow of perfect day:<br />
 <br />
Extinguish thou each sinful fire,<br />
And banish every ill desire;<br />
And while thou keep’st the body whole,<br />
Shed forth thy peace upon the soul.<br />
 <br />
* Almighty Father, hear our cry,<br />
Through Jesus Christ, our Lord most High,<br />
Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,<br />
Doth live and reign eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 40</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">40:2</span>  Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the poor: * the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.<br />
<span class="w">40:3</span>  The Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth: * and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.<br />
<span class="w">40:4</span>  The Lord help him on his bed of sorrow: * thou hast turned all his couch in his sickness.<br />
<span class="w">40:5</span>  I said: O Lord, be thou merciful to me: * heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.<br />
<span class="w">40:6</span>  My enemies have spoken evils against me: * when shall he die and his name perish?<br />
<span class="w">40:7</span>  And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things: * his heart gathered together iniquity to itself.<br />
<span class="w">40:7</span>  He went out * and spoke to the same purpose.<br />
<span class="w">40:8</span>  All my enemies whispered together against me: * they devised evils to me.<br />
<span class="w">40:9</span>  They determined against me an unjust word: * shall he that sleepeth rise again no more?<br />
<span class="w">40:10</span>  For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, * who ate my bread, hath greatly supplanted me.<br />
<span class="w">40:11</span>  But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again: * and I will requite them.<br />
<span class="w">40:12</span>  By this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me: * because my enemy shall not rejoice over me.<br />
<span class="w">40:13</span>  But thou hast upheld me by reason of my innocence: * and hast established me in thy sight for ever.<br />
<span class="w">40:14</span>  Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity. * So be it. So be it.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 41(2-6)</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">41:2</span>  As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; * so my soul panteth after thee, O God.<br />
<span class="w">41:3</span>  My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; * when shall I come and appear before the face of God?<br />
<span class="w">41:4</span>  My tears have been my bread day and night, * whilst it is said to me daily: Where is thy God?<br />
<span class="w">41:5</span>  These things I remembered, and poured out my soul in me: * for I shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even to the house of God:<br />
<span class="w">41:5</span>  With the voice of joy and praise; * the noise of one feasting.<br />
<span class="w">41:6</span>  Why art thou sad, O my soul? * and why dost thou trouble me?<br />
<span class="w">41:6</span>  Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: * the salvation of my countenance, and my God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">41:7</span>  My soul is troubled within myself: * therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little hill.<br />
<span class="w">41:8</span>  Deep calleth on deep, * at the noise of thy flood-gates.<br />
<span class="w">41:8</span>  All thy heights and thy billows * have passed over me.<br />
<span class="w">41:9</span>  In the daytime the Lord hath commanded his mercy; * and a canticle to him in the night.<br />
<span class="w">41:9</span>  With me is prayer to the God of my life. * I will say to God: Thou art my support.<br />
<span class="w">41:10</span>  Why hast thou forgotten me? * and why go I mourning, whilst my enemy afflicteth me?<br />
<span class="w">41:11</span>  Whilst my bones are broken, * my enemies who trouble me have reproached me;<br />
<span class="w">41:11</span>  Whilst they say to me day by day: Where is thy God? * Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?<br />
<span class="w">41:12</span>  Hope thou in God, for I will still give praise to him: * the salvation of my countenance, and my God.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
