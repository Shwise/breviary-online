<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Gen 49:10</span><br />
<i class="a">T</i>he sceptre shall not be taken away from Juda, nor a ruler from his thigh, till he comes that is to be sent, and he shall be the expectation of nations.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">B</i>right builder of the heavenly poles,<br />
Eternal light of faithful souls, <br />
Jesus, Redeemer of mankind, <br />
Our humble prayers vouchsafe to mind.<br />
 <br />
Who, lest the fraud of hell’s black king<br />
Should all men to destruction bring,<br />
Didst, by an act of generous love, <br />
The fainting world’s physician prove.<br />
 <br />
Who, that thou mightst our ransom pay<br />
And wash the stains of sin away, <br />
Wouldst from a Virgin’s womb proceed<br />
And on the cross a victim bleed.<br />
 <br />
Whose glorious power, whose saving name<br />
No sooner any voice can frame, <br />
But heaven and earth and hell agree<br />
To honour them with trembling knee.<br />
 <br />
Thee, Christ, who at the latter day<br />
Shalt be our Judge, we humbly pray<br />
Such arms of heavenly grace to send<br />
As may thy Church from foes defend.<br />
 <br />
Be glory given and honour done<br />
To God the Father and the Son<br />
And to the Holy Ghost on high,<br />
From age to age eternally.<br />
Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Drop down dew, ye heavens, from above, and let the clouds rain the Just.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Let the earth be opened, and bud forth the Savior.<br />

<span class="w">1:47</span> And my spirit hath rejoiced * in God my Saviour.<br />

<span class="w">1:52</span> He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble.<br />
<span class="w">1:53</span> He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
<span class="w">1:54</span> He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy:<br />
<span class="w">1:55</span> As he spoke to our fathers, * to Abraham and to his seed for ever.<br />
