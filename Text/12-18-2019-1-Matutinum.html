<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the season of the Church year}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">C</i>elestial Word, to this our earth<br />
Sent down from God's eternal clime,<br />
To save mankind by mortal birth <br />
Into a world of change and time;<br />
 <br />
Enlighten our hearts; vain hopes destroy;<br />
And in thy love's consuming fire <br />
Fill all the soul with heavenly joy, <br />
And melt the dross of low desire.<br />
 <br />
So when the Judge of quick and dead<br />
Shall bid his awful summons come,<br />
To whelm the guilty soul with dread,<br />
And call the blessed to their home.<br />
 <br />
Saved from the whirling, black abyss,<br />
Forevermore to us be given <br />
To share the feast of saintly bliss, <br />
And see the face of God in heaven.<br />
 <br />
To God the Father and the Son <br />
Our songs with one accord we raise;<br />
And to the Holy Spirit, One <br />
With them, be ever equal praise<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 44(2-10)</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">44:2</span>  My heart hath uttered a good word; * I speak my works to the King.<br />
<span class="w">44:2</span>  My tongue is the pen of a scrivener * that writeth swiftly.<br />

<span class="w">44:7</span>  Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: * the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness.<br />
<span class="w">44:8</span>  Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: * therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br />
<span class="w">44:9</span>  Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: * out of which the daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory.<br />
<span class="w">44:10</span>  The queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; * surrounded with variety.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Luke<br />
<span class="ri">Luke 1:26-38</span><br />
At that time the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth, To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Ambrose, Bishop <span class="w">of Milan.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Bk. ii on Luke</span><br />
The mysteries of God are unsearchable, and it is especially declared by a Prophet, that a man can hardly know His counsels. <span class="w">Wisd. ix. 13.</span> Nevertheless, some things have been revealed to us, and we may gather from some of the words and works of the Lord our Saviour, that there was a special purpose of God, in the fact that she who was chosen to be the mother of the Lord was espoused to a man. Why did not the power of the Highest overshadow her before she was so espoused? Perhaps it was lest any might blasphemously say that she had conceived in fornication the Holy One.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> O thou that bringest good tidings of peace to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength!<br />
* Say unto the cities of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Behold, our God will come, for Whom we waited.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountain, lift up thy voice with strength.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Say unto the cities of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Behold, our God will come, for Whom we waited.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>God's most mighty strength alway be His people's staff and stay. Amen. <br />

And the angel came in unto her. Let us learn from this Virgin how to bear ourselves, let us learn her modesty, let us learn by her devout utterance, above all let us learn by the holy mystery enacted. It is the part of a maiden to be timid, to avoid the advances of men, and to shrink from men's addresses. Would that our women would learn from the example of modesty here set before us. She upon whom the stare of men had never been fixed was alone in her chamber, and was found only by an angel. There was neither companion nor witness there, that what passed might not be debased in gossip and the angel saluted her.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Man shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite through all the princes of the aliens.<br />
* And all the earth shall be His possession.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> All kings shall fall down before Him, all nations shall serve Him.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And all the earth shall be His possession.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

<b>Reading 3</b><br />
The message of God to the Virgin was a mystery, which it was not lawful for the mouth of men, but only of angels, to utter. For the first time on earth the words are spoken The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee. The holy maiden heareth, and believeth. At length she saith Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word. Here is an example of lowliness, here is a pattern of true devotion. At the very moment that she is told she is chosen to be the mother of the Lord she at once declareth herself His handmaid. The knowledge that she was mother of God caused in the heart of Mary only an act of humility.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
