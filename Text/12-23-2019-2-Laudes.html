<b>Psalms</b> <em>{Laudes:2 Psalms and antiphons  from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Behold, the Lord cometh, * the Prince of the Kings of the earth: blessed are they that are ready to go forth to meet him. <br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 50</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  Have mercy on me, O God, * according to thy great mercy.<br />
<span class="w">50:3</span>  And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies * blot out my iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">50:4</span>  Wash me yet more from my iniquity, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br />
<span class="w">50:5</span>  For I know my iniquity, * and my sin is always before me.<br />
<span class="w">50:6</span>  To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: * that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br />
<span class="w">50:7</span>  For behold I was conceived in iniquities; * and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br />
<span class="w">50:8</span>  For behold thou hast loved truth: * the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br />
<span class="w">50:9</span>  Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br />
<span class="w">50:10</span>  To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: * and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.<br />
<span class="w">50:11</span>  Turn away thy face from my sins, * and blot out all my iniquities.<br />
<span class="w">50:12</span>  Create a clean heart in me, O God: * and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br />
<span class="w">50:13</span>  Cast me not away from thy face; * and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br />
<span class="w">50:14</span>  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, * and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.<br />
<span class="w">50:15</span>  I will teach the unjust thy ways: * and the wicked shall be converted to thee.<br />
<span class="w">50:16</span>  Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: * and my tongue shall extol thy justice.<br />
<span class="w">50:17</span>  O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: * and my mouth shall declare thy praise.<br />
<span class="w">50:18</span>  For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: * with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.<br />
<span class="w">50:19</span>  A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: * a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br />
<span class="w">50:20</span>  Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; * that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.<br />
<span class="w">50:21</span>  Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: * then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />

<span class="w">5:2</span>  Give ear, O Lord, to my words * understand my cry.<br />
<span class="w">5:3</span>  Hearken to the voice of my prayer, * O my King and my God.<br />
<span class="w">5:4</span>  For to thee will I pray: * O Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my voice.<br />
<span class="w">5:5</span>  In the morning I will stand before thee, and will see: * because thou art not a God that willest iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">5:6</span>  Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee: * nor shall the unjust abide before thy eyes.<br />
<span class="w">5:7</span>  Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity: * thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie.<br />
<span class="w">5:7</span>  The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor. * But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy,<br />
<span class="w">5:8</span>  I will come into thy house; * I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear.<br />
<span class="w">5:9</span>  Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice: * because of my enemies, direct my way in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">5:10</span>  For there is no truth in their mouth: * their heart is vain.<br />
<span class="w">5:11</span>  Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully with their tongues: * judge them, O God.<br />
<span class="w">5:11</span>  Let them fall from their devices: according to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out: * for they have provoked thee, O Lord.<br />
<span class="w">5:12</span>  But let all them be glad that hope in thee: * they shall rejoice for ever, and thou shalt dwell in them.<br />
<span class="w">5:12</span>  And all they that love thy name shall glory in thee: * For thou wilt bless the just.<br />
<span class="w">5:13</span>  O Lord, thou hast crowned us, * as with a shield of thy good will.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> Behold, the fulness * of the time is come, when God sent forth his Son into the world. <br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 28</span><em> [3]</em><br />

<span class="w">28:4</span>  The voice of the Lord is in power; * the voice of the Lord in magnificence.<br />
<span class="w">28:5</span>  The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars: * yea, the Lord shall break the cedars of Libanus.<br />
<span class="w">28:6</span>  And shall reduce them to pieces, as a calf of Libanus, * and as the beloved son of unicorns.<br />
<span class="w">28:7</span>  The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire: * The voice of the Lord shaketh the desert: and the Lord shall shake the desert of Cades.<br />
<span class="w">28:9</span>  The voice of the Lord prepareth the stags: and he will discover the thick woods: * and in his temple all shall speak his glory.<br />
<span class="w">28:10</span>  The Lord maketh the flood to dwell: * and the Lord shall sit king for ever.<br />
<span class="w">28:11</span>  The Lord will give strength to his people: * the Lord will bless his people with peace.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">12:2</span>  Behold, God is my saviour, * I will deal confidently, and will not fear:<br />
<span class="w">12:3</span>  Because the Lord is my strength, and my praise, * and he is become my salvation.<br />

<b>Chapter Hymn Verse</b> <em>{from the Psalter for the day of the week}</em>
<br />
<span class="ri">Isa 2:3</span><br />
<i class="a">C</i>ome and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<br />

<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">H</i>ark, a herald voice is calling;<br />
“Christ is nigh,” it seems to say; <br />
“Cast away the dreams of darkness, <br />
O ye children of the day.”<br />
 <br />
Startled at the solemn warning, <br />
Let the earth-bound soul arise; <br />
Christ, her sun, all sloth dispelling,<br />
Shines upon the morning skies.<br />
 <br />
Lo, the Lamb, so long expected, <br />
Comes with pardon down from heaven;<br />
Let us haste, with tears of sorrow, <br />
One and all to be forgiven.<br />
 <br />
So when next he comes with glory,<br />
Wrapping all the earth in fear, <br />
May he then as our defender <br />
On the clouds of heaven appear.<br />
 <br />
Honour, glory, virtue, merit,<br />
To the Father and the Son,<br />
With the co-eternal Spirit,<br />
While eternal ages run.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">V.</span> A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord.<br />
