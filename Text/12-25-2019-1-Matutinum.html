<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">J</i>esus, the Ransomer of man, <br />
Who, ere created light began, <br />
Didst from the sovereign Father spring,<br />
His power and glory equalling.<br />
 <br />
The Father’s Light and Splendor Thou,<br />
Their endless hope to Thee that bow;<br />
Accept the prayers and praise to-day<br />
That through the world Thy servants pay.<br />
 <br />
Salvation’s Author, call to mind<br />
How, taking form of humankind,<br />
Born of a Virgin undefiled,<br />
Thou in man’s flesh becam’st a Child.<br />
 <br />
Thus testifies the present day, <br />
Through every year in long array, <br />
That Thou, salvation’s source alone,<br />
Proceedest from the Father’s throne.<br />
 <br />
The heavens above, the rolling main<br />
And all that earth’s wide realms contain,<br />
With joyous voice now loudly sing<br />
The glory of their new-born King.<br />
 <br />
And we who, by Thy precious Blood<br />
From sin redeemed, are marked for God,<br />
On this the day that saw Thy birth,<br />
Sing the new song of ransomed earth.<br />
 <br />
O Lord, the Virgin-born, to Thee<br />
Eternal praise and glory be, <br />
Whom with the Father we adore <br />
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath said unto Me: * Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten thee.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 2</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">2:1</span>  Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?<br />
<span class="w">2:2</span>  The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, * against the Lord and against his Christ.<br />
<span class="w">2:3</span>  Let us break their bonds asunder: * and let us cast away their yoke from us.<br />
<span class="w">2:4</span>  He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: * and the Lord shall deride them.<br />
<span class="w">2:5</span>  Then shall he speak to them in his anger, * and trouble them in his rage.<br />
<span class="w">2:6</span>  But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain, * preaching his commandment.<br />
<span class="w">2:7</span>  The Lord hath said to me: * Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.<br />
<span class="w">2:8</span>  Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, * and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.<br />
<span class="w">2:9</span>  Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, * and shalt break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.<br />
<span class="w">2:10</span>  And now, O ye kings, understand: * receive instruction, you that judge the earth.<br />
<span class="w">2:11</span>  Serve ye the Lord with fear: * and rejoice unto him with trembling.<br />
<span class="w">2:12</span>  Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, * and you perish from the just way.<br />
<span class="w">2:13</span>  When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, * blessed are all they that trust in him.<br />

<span class="w">18:6</span>  Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,<br />
<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">18:9</span>  The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">18:10</span>  The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.<br />
<span class="w">18:11</span>  More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br />
<span class="w">18:12</span>  For thy servant keepeth them, * and in keeping them there is a great reward.<br />
<span class="w">18:13</span>  Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: * and from those of others spare thy servant.<br />
<span class="w">18:14</span>  If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />

<span class="w">44:7</span>  Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: * the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness.<br />
<span class="w">44:8</span>  Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: * therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br />
<span class="w">44:9</span>  Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: * out of which the daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory.<br />
<span class="w">44:10</span>  The queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; * surrounded with variety.<br />
<span class="w">44:11</span>  Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thy ear: * and forget thy people and thy father’s house.<br />

<span class="w">44:13</span>  And the daughters of Tyre with gifts, * yea, all the rich among the people, shall entreat thy countenance.<br />
<span class="w">44:14</span>  All the glory of the king’s daughter is within, * in golden borders, clothed round about with varieties.<br />
<span class="w">44:15</span>  After her shall virgins be brought to the king: * her neighbours shall be brought to thee.<br />
<span class="w">44:16</span>  They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing: * they shall be brought into the temple of the king.<br />
<span class="w">44:17</span>  Instead of thy fathers, sons are born to thee: * thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.<br />
<span class="w">44:18</span>  They shall remember thy name * throughout all generations.<br />

From the Sermons of Pope St. Leo (the Great)<br />
<span class="ri">1st for Christmas.</span><br />
Dearly beloved brethren, Unto us is born this day a Saviour, <span class="w">Luke ii. 11.</span> Let us rejoice. It would be unlawful to be sad to day, for today is Life's Birthday; the Birthday of that Life, Which, for us dying creatures, taketh away the sting of death, and bringeth the bright promise of the eternal gladness hereafter. It would be unlawful for any man to refuse to partake in our rejoicing. All men have an equal share in the great cause of our joy, for, since our Lord, Who is the destroyer of sin and of death, findeth that all are bound under the condemnation, He is come to make all free. Rejoice, O thou that art holy, thou drawest nearer to thy crown! Rejoice, O thou that art sinful, thy Saviour offereth thee pardon! Rejoice also, O thou Gentile, God calleth thee to life! For the Son of God, when the fulness of the time was come, which had been fixed by the unsearchable counsel of God, took upon Him the nature of man, that He might reconcile that nature to Him Who made it, and so the devil, the inventor of death, is met and beaten in that very flesh which hath been the field of his victory.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> How great is this mystery, how wonderful is the teaching of the faith! The beasts saw the new-born Lord lying in a manger.<br />
* Blessed is that Virgin whose womb was made meet to bear our Lord Christ.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Hail, Mary, full of grace the Lord is with thee.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Blessed is that Virgin whose womb was made meet to bear our Lord Christ.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May Christ to all His people give, for ever in His sight to live. Amen.<br />

When our Lord entered the field of battle against the devil, He did so with a great and wonderful fairness. Being Himself the Almighty, He laid aside His uncreated Majesty to fight with our cruel enemy in our weak flesh. He brought against him the very shape, the very nature of our mortality, yet without sin. <span class="w">Heb. iv. 15.</span> His birth however was not a birth like other births for no other is born pure, nay, not the little child whose life endureth but a day on the earth. To His birth alone the throes of human passion had not contributed, in His alone no consequence of sin had had part. For His Mother was chosen a Virgin of the kingly lineage of David, and when she was to grow heavy with the sacred Child, her soul had already conceived Him before her body. She knew the counsel of God announced to her by the Angel, lest the unwonted events should alarm her. The future Mother of God knew what was to be wrought in her by the Holy Ghost, and that her modesty was absolutely safe.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Blessed is God's holy Mother, Mary, maiden undefiled.<br />
* This day hath she brought forth the Saviour of the world.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Blessed is she that believed; for there is a performance of all those things which were told her from the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> This day hath she brought forth the Saviour of the world.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Spirit's fire Divine in our hearts enkindled shine. Amen. <br />

Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us give thanks to God the Father, through His Son, in the Holy Ghost: Who, for His great love wherewith He loved us, hath had mercy on us and, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, <span class="w">Eph. ii. 4, 5,</span> that in Him we might be a new creature, and a new workmanship. Let us then put off the old man with his deeds <span class="w">Col. iii. 9</span>; and, having obtained a share in the Sonship of Christ, let us renounce the deeds of the flesh. Learn, O Christian, how great thou art, who hast been made partaker of the Divine nature, <span class="w">2 Pet. i. 4,</span> and fall not again by corrupt conversation into the beggarly elements above which thou art lifted. Remember Whose Body it is Whereof thou art made a member, and Who is its Head, <span class="w">1 Cor. vi. 15.</span> Remember that it is He That hath delivered thee from the power of darkness and hath translated thee into God's light, and God's kingdom, <span class="w">Col. i. 13.</span><br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

<span class="ri">8th on the Gospels.</span><br />
By God's mercy we are to say three Masses today, so that there is not much time left for preaching; but at the same time the occasion of the Lord's Birthday itself obliges me to speak a few words. I will first ask why, when the Lord was to be born, the world was enrolled? Was it not to herald the appearing of Him by Whom the elect are enrolled in the book of life? Whereas the Prophet saith of<br />
the reprobate: Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. <span class="w">Ps. lxviii. 29.</span> Then, the Lord is born in Bethlehem. Now the name Bethlehem signifieth the House of Bread, and thus it is the birth-place of Him Who hath said: I am the Living Bread, Which came down from heaven. <span class="w">John vi. 51.</span> We see then that this name of Bethlehem was prophetically given to the place where Christ was born, because it was there that He was to appear in the flesh by Whom the souls of the faithful are fed unto life eternal. He was born, not in His Mother's house, but away from home. And this is a mystery, showing that this our mortality into which He was born was not the home of Him Who is begotten of the Father before the worlds.<br />

Behold the beginning of the Church.

And that shepherd is wide awake, whom the Good Shepherd stirreth up. The flock then is the people, the night is the world, and the shepherds are the Priests.

<span class="ri">1st Tract on John.</span><br />
Lest thou shouldest think all things mean, as thou art accustomed to think of things human, hear and digest this The Word was God. Now perhaps there will come forward some Arian unbeliever, and say that the Word of God was a creature. How can the Word of God be a creature, when it was by the Word that all creatures were made? If He be a creature, then there must have been some other Word, not a creature, by which He was made. And what Word is that? If thou sayest that it was by the word of the Word Himself that He was made, I tell thee that God had no other, but One Only-begotten Son. But if thou say not that it was by the word of the Word Himself that He was made, thou art forced to confess that. He by Whom all things were made was not Himself made at all.
