<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">O</i> God, of those that fought thy fight,<br />
Portion, and prize, and crown of light,<br />
Break every bond of sin and shame<br />
As now we praise thy martyr's name.<br />
 <br />
He recked not of the world's allure,<br />
But sin and pomp of sin forswore:<br />
Knew all their gall, and passed them by,<br />
And reached the throne prepared on high.<br />
 <br />
Bravely the course of pain he ran,<br />
And bare his torments as a man:<br />
For love of thee his blood outpoured,<br />
And thus obtained the great reward.<br />
 <br />
With humble voice and suppliant word<br />
We pray thee therefore, holy Lord,<br />
While we thy martyr's feast-day keep,<br />
Forgive thy loved and erring sheep.<br />
 <br />
* Glory and praise for aye be done<br />
To God the Father, and the Son,<br />
And Holy Ghost, who reign on high,<br />
One God, to all eternity.<br />
Amen.<br />

Lesson from the Acts of Apostles<br />
<span class="ri">Acts 6:1-6</span><br />
<span class="w">1</span> And in those days, the number of the disciples increasing, there arose a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, for that their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.<br />
<span class="w">2</span> Then the twelve calling together the multitude of the disciples, said: It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> And the saying was liked by all the multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.<br />
<span class="w">6</span> These they set before the apostles; and they praying, imposed hands upon them.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And Stephen, full of grace and power<br />
* Did great wonders and miracles among the people.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> There arose certain of the synagogue, disputing with Stephen; and they were not able to resist the wisdom, and the Spirit which spoke.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Did great wonders and miracles among the people.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May the Son, the Sole-begotten, mercifully bless and keep us. Amen. <br />

<span class="w">7</span> And the word of the Lord increased; and the number of the disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly: a great multitude also of the priests obeyed the faith.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> And Stephen, full of grace and fortitude, did great wonders and signs among the people.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> Now there arose some of that which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them that were of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit that spoke.<br />
<span class="w">54</span> Now hearing these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed with their teeth at him.<br />

<span class="w">56</span> And they crying out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and with one accord ran violently upon him.<br />
<span class="w">57</span> And casting him forth without the city, they stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.<br />
<span class="w">58</span> And they stoned Stephen, invoking, and saying: Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.<br />
<span class="w">59</span> And falling on his knees, he cried with a loud voice, saying: Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep in the Lord.<br />

From the Sermons of St. Fulgentius, Bishop <span class="w">of Ruspe.</span><br />
<span class="ri">On St. Stephen.</span><br />
Yesterday we were celebrating the birth in time of our Eternal King; today we celebrate the victory, through suffering, of one of His soldiers. Yesterday our King was pleased to come forth from His royal palace of the Virgin's womb, clothed in a robe of flesh, to visit the world; today His soldier, laying aside the tabernacle of the body, entereth in triumph into the heavenly palaces. The One, preserving unchanged that glory of the Godhead which He had before the world was, girded Himself with the form of a servant, and entered the arena of this world to fight sin; the other taketh off the garments of this corruptible body, and entereth into the heavenly mansions, where he will reign for ever. The One cometh down, veiled in flesh; the other goeth up, clothed in a robe of glory, red with blood.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> They stoned Stephen, calling upon God and saying:<br />
* Lord Jesus Christ, receive my spirit; and lay not this sin to their charge.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, saying<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Lord Jesus Christ, receive my spirit; and lay not this sin to their charge.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May Christ to all His people give, for ever in His sight to live. Amen.<br />

The One cometh down amid the jubilation of angels; the other goeth up amid the stoning of the Jews. Yesterday the holy angels were singing, Glory to God in the highest; today there is joy among them, for they receive Stephen into their company. Yesterday the Lord came forth from the Virgin's womb; today His soldier is delivered from the prison of the body. Yesterday Christ was for our sakes wrapped in swaddling bands; today He girdeth Stephen with a robe of immortality. Yesterday the new-born Christ lay in a narrow manger; today Stephen entereth victorious into the boundless heavens. The Lord came down alone that He might raise many up; our King humbled Himself that He might set His soldiers in high places.<br />

Why brethren, it behoveth us to consider with what arms Stephen was able, amid all the cruelty of the Jews, to remain more than conqueror, and worthily to attain to so blessed a triumph. Stephen, in that struggle which brought him to the crown whereof his name is a prophecy, had for armour the love of God and man, and by it he remained victorious on all hands. The love of God strengthened him against the cruelty of the Jews; and the love of his neighbour made him pray even for his murderers. Through love he rebuked the wandering, that they might be corrected; through love he prayed for them that stoned him, that they might not be punished. By the might of his love he overcame Saul his cruel persecutor; and earned for a comrade in heaven, the very man who had done him to death upon earth.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 23:34-39</span><br />
At that time, Jesus said to the scribes and pharisee: I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you will put to death and crucify. And so on,<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Jerome, Priest <span class="w">at Bethlehem.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Book iv. Commentary on Matth. xxiii.</span><br />
We have already remarked that the Lord's words, Fill ye up the measure of your fathers, <span class="w">32,</span> refer in the first place to Himself, Whom the Jews afterwards put to death. In a secondary sense it may likewise be applied to His disciples, of whom He saith, Behold, I send unto you Prophets, and wise men, and Scribes. Here observe that, according to the Apostle writing to the Corinthians, <span class="w">1 Cor. xii. 4,</span> there are diversities of gifts among Christ's followers. Some are Prophets of that which is to come; some are wise men, who know the due season for rebuke and exhortation; some are Scribes learned in the law. And of these they stoned Stephen, slew Paul with the sword, crucified Peter, and scourged the Disciples mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles. <span class="w">v. 40; xvi. 23.</span><br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Stephen, the servant of God, who was stoned by the Jews, saw the heavens opened he saw and entered in.<br />
* Blessed is he, unto whom the heavens were opened.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> While his poor body was crushed by the hurtling shower of stones, God's brightness broke upon him out of the heavenly palaces.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Blessed is he unto whom the heavens were opened.<br />

It is a subject of dispute among commentators who is meant by Zacharias the son of Barachias. We read of several persons of the name of Zacharias. But here, in order to prevent any mistake, it is particularly said, Whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. I have read various opinions in various places upon this question, and I will give each. First, some hold that Zacharias the son of Barachias is the eleventh of the twelve Minor Prophets; and this opinion is supported by the father's name. But the Bible nowhere telleth us that this Prophet was slain between the temple and the altar; and it is hardly possible that he can have been, for in his time it could scarcely be said that even the ruins of the temple were in existence. Secondly, others maintain that this Zacharias was Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist. This interpretation is derived from the dreams of the Apocryphal Gospels, wherein it is asserted that he was martyred for preaching Christ's coming.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The gates of heaven were opened to Christ's blessed martyr Stephen, and he is the first of all the martyrs.<br />
* Wherefore he reigneth crowned in heaven.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> For he was the first to make an offering of his death to that Saviour Who vouchsafed to suffer death for us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Wherefore he reigneth crowned in heaven.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Wherefore he reigneth crowned in heaven.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May He that is the Angels' King to that high realm His people bring. Amen. <br />

A third school will have it that this Zacharias, the son of Barachias, was that Zacharias of whom we read, in Chron. xxiv. 22, that he was slain by Joash, king of Judah, between the temple and the altar. Against this it is to be remarked, that that Zacharias was not the son of Barachias, but of Jehoiada the priest; whence it is written, Joash remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him. The question therefore ariseth, if this opinion be true, why, the name and manner of death both agreeing with this explanation, Zacharias is called the son, not of Jehoiada, but of Barachias. In Hebrew, Barachias signifieth the Blessed of the Lord, and Jehoiada proves his Righteousness. In the Gospel used by the Nazarenes the name of Jehoiada is used instead of Barachias.<br />
