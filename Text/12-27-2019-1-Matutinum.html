<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">T</i>h' eternal gifts of Christ the King,<br />
The Apostles' glory, let us sing;<br />
And all with hearts of gladness raise<br />
Due hymns of thankful love and praise.<br />
 <br />
For they the Church's princes are,<br />
Triumphant leaders in the war,<br />
The heavenly King's own warrior band,<br />
True lights to lighten every land.<br />
 <br />
Theirs was the steadfast faith of saints,<br />
The hope that never yields nor faints,<br />
The love of Christ in perfect glow,<br />
That lay the prince of this world low.<br />
 <br />
In them the Father's glory shone,<br />
In them the Spirit's will was done,<br />
The Son himself exults in them;<br />
Joy fills the new Jerusalem.<br />
 <br />
* Praise to the Father, with the Son,<br />
And Holy Spirit, Three in One;<br />
As ever was in ages past,<br />
And so shall be while ages last.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">18:9</span>  The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">18:10</span>  The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.<br />
<span class="w">18:11</span>  More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br />

<span class="w">1</span> That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life:<br />
<span class="w">2</span> For the life was manifested; and we have seen and do bear witness, and declare unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father, and hath appeared to us:<br />
<span class="w">3</span> That which we have seen and have heard, we declare unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship may be with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> And these things we write to you, that you may rejoice, and your joy may be full.<br />
<span class="w">5</span> And this is the declaration which we have heard from him, and declare unto you: That God is light, and in him there is no darkness.<br />

* To Him did Christ upon the Cross commit His mother, virgin to virgin.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The Lord chose him for his clean maidenhood, and loved him more than all the rest.<br />

<span class="w">7</span> But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<br />
<span class="w">8</span> If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.<br />
<span class="w">9</span> If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all iniquity.<br />
<span class="w">10</span> If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.<br />

<span class="w">2</span> And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.<br />
<span class="w">3</span> And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments.<br />
<span class="w">4</span> He who saith that he knoweth him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.<br />

The Apostle John whom Jesus loved was a son of Zebedee, and brother of the Apostle James, who was beheaded by Herod soon after our Lord suffered. He was the last of the Evangelists to write his Gospel, which he published at the request of the Bishops of Asia, against Cerinthus and other heretics, and particularly against the then spreading doctrine of the Ebionites, who asserted that Christ had had no existence before Mary. It was therefore needful for the Evangelist to declare His Eternal and Divine Generation.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in My temple, saith the Lord,<br />
* And I will write My name upon him, and the name of the city, which is New Jerusalem.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of My God.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And I will write My name upon him, and the name of the city, which is New Jerusalem.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>May Christ to all His people give, for ever in His sight to live. Amen.<br />

In the fourteenth year after Nero, Domitian stirred up the second persecution, and John was exiled to the island of Patmos, where he wrote his Apocalypse, which hath been explained by Justin the Martyr and Irenaeus. When Domitian was killed, the Senate annulled all his acts, on account of his savage cruelty, and the Apostle returned to Ephesus, during the reign of Nerva. He remained at Ephesus until the time of Trajan, and founded and governed all the Churches of Asia. There, in an extreme old age, he died, in the sixty-eighth year after the Lord's passion, and was buried near the city.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> Jesus loved him, because his singular gift of purity made him more worthy of love.<br />
* He chose him for a virgin unto Himself, and he remaineth a virgin for ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> At the end, when He was dying upon the Cross, to him did He commit His mother, maiden to maiden.<br />

From the Commentary upon the Epistle to the Galatians, by the same author<br />
<span class="ri">iii. 6.</span><br />
The Blessed Evangelist John lived at Ephesus down to an extreme old age, and, at length, when he was with difficulty carried to the Church, and was not able to exhort the congregation at length, he was used simply to say at each meeting, My little children, love one another. At last the disciples and brethren were weary with hearing these words continually, and asked him, Master, wherefore ever sayest thou this only? Whereto he replied to them, <span class="w">worthy of John,</span> It is the commandment of the Lord, and if this only be done, it is enough.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> In the midst of the congregation did the Lord open his mouth.<br />
* And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> He made him rich with joy and gladness.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to John<br />

In that time Jesus said to Peter: Follow me. Peter turning about, saw that disciple whom Jesus loved following. And so on.<br />

Homily on this passage by St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo,</span><br />
<span class="ri">124 on the Tract on John</span><br />
The Church knoweth of two different lives which God hath revealed and blessed one is the life of faith, the other the life of knowledge one the life of this pilgrimage, the other the life of the eternal mansions; one the life of work, the other the life of rest one the life of the journey, the other the life of home; one the life of action, the other the life of contemplation. The one escheweth evil and doeth good; the other hath no evil to eschew, and only an exceeding good to enjoy. The one striveth with the enemy, the other hath no enemies, and reigneth.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> In that day will I take thee, O My servant, and will make thee as a signet before Me.<br />
* For I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> For I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Grant, Lord, a blessing.<br />
<span class="ri">Benediction. </span>He whose feast-day we are keeping, be our Advocate with God. Amen. <br />

<b>Reading 8</b><br />
The one succoureth the needy; the other is where there are no needy to succour. The one forgiveth them that trespass against it, that its own trespasses may be forgiven; the other neither hath trespasses to forgive nor to be forgiven. The one is chastened with evil, lest it be exalted above measure by good; the other enjoyeth such a fulness of grace that it feeleth no evil, and cleaveth so firmly unto the Highest Good, that it hath no temptation to pride.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />

Therefore the one is good, but still sorrowful; the other is better and perfectly blessed. And of these two lives there are types, of the one in the Apostle Peter, of the other in John. The one laboureth here even unto the end, and findeth its end hereafter; the other stretcheth out into the hereafter, and in eternity findeth no end. Therefore is it said unto the one, Follow Me; but of the other, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me. What is the meaning of these words? who can know? who can understand? what is it? is it Follow thou Me, imitating Me in the bearing of earthly sorrow; let him tarry till I come again, bringing the everlasting reward?<br />
