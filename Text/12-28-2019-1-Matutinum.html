<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Proper of Saints}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">W</i>ith terror doth the tyrant hear<br />
The King of kings hath come to dwell<br />
Where David's court shall widely rear<br />
A sceptered reign o'er Israel.<br />
 <br />
Then cries out, raging, at the word:<br />
“He comes to stand where we have stood:<br />
Hence, soldier, and with ruthless sword<br />
Deluge the cradles deep with blood!”<br />
 <br />
What profiteth a crime so dread?<br />
What hope shall Herod's bosom sway?<br />
Alone amidst the thronging dead,<br />
The Christ is safely borne away!<br />
 <br />
All glory for this blessed morn<br />
To God the Father ever be;<br />
All praise to thee, Virgin-born,<br />
All praise, Holy Ghost, to thee.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="w">16</span> Thus saith the Lord: Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thy eyes from tears: for there is a reward for thy work, saith the Lord: and they shall return out of the land of the enemy.<br />

From the Sermons of St. Augustine, Bishop <span class="w">of Hippo.</span><br />
<span class="ri">10th on the Saints.</span><br />
Dearly beloved brethren, today we keep the birthday of those children, who, as we are informed by the Gospel, were massacred by the savage King Herod. Therefore let earth rejoice with exceeding joy, for she is the mother of these heavenly soldiers, and of this numerous host. The love of the vile Herod could never have crowned these blessed ones as hath his hatred. For the Church testifieth by this holy solemnity, that whereas iniquity did specially abound against these little saints, so much the more were heavenly blessings poured out upon them.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The blood of thy saints have they shed like water round about Jerusalem.<br />
* And there was none to bury them.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the air, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> And there was none to bury them.<br />

Blessed art thou, O Bethlehem in the land of Judah, which hast suffered the cruelty of King Herod in the slaughter of thy children; who art found worthy to offer at once to God a whole white-robed army of guileless martyrs! Surely, it is well to keep their birth-day, even that blessed birthday which gave them from earth to heaven, more blessed than the day that brought them out of their mother's womb. Scarcely had they entered on the life that now is, when they obtained that glorious life which is to come.<br />

We praise the death of other martyrs because it was the crowning act of an undaunted and persistent testimony; but these were crowned at once. He That maketh an end to this present life, gave to them at its very gates that eternal blessedness which we hope for at its close. They whom the wickedness of Herod tore from their mothers' breasts are rightfully called the flowers of martyrdom; hardly had these buds of the Church shown their heads above the soil, in the winter of unbelief, when the frost of persecution nipped them.<br />

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew<br />
<span class="ri">Matt 2:13-18</span><br />
At that time, an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and fly into Egypt: and be there until I shall tell thee. And so on.<br />
 <br />
Homily by St. Jerome, Priest <span class="w">at Bethlehem.</span><br />
<span class="ri">Book i. Comment, on Matth. ii.</span><br />
He took the young Child, and His mother, and fled into Egypt, by night and in darkness; and the darkness of that night was a figure of the darkness of ignorance in which they left the unbelievers from whom they fled. But when they returned into Judaea, we learn not from the Gospel that it was by night, or in darkness; which is an image of that light which will lighten the Jews, when, at the end of the world, they shall receive back the faith, which now lighteneth the Gentiles, even as Judaea received Christ returning from Egypt.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> The saints sung a new song before the throne of God and the Lamb.<br />
* And their voices were echoed on earth.<br />

<span class="ri">R.</span> And their voices were echoed on earth.<br />

That it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying Out of Egypt have I called My Son. Those who go about to deny the authority of the Hebrew Scriptures, ask where any such passage is to be found in the Septuagint. But, although they find it not there, I tell them that the fact of its being written in the Prophet Hosea <span class="w">xi. i</span> can be proved by the texts which I have lately published.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Thanks be to God.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> I saw under the Altar of God the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, which they held, and they cried with a loud voice<br />
* Avenge, O Lord, the blood of thy saints, which is shed.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Under the throne of God all the saints cry aloud<br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> Avenge, O Lord, the blood of thy saints, which is shed.<br />

<b>Reading 9</b><br />
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the Prophet, saying; In Rama was there a voice heard, weeping and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children. The child of Rachel was Benjamin, and Bethlehem is not a town belonging to his tribe. We must therefore seek another reason why Rachel should weep for the children of Judah, to whom Bethlehem belongeth, as for her own. The plain answer is that she is buried at Ephrath close to Bethlehem, and she is called Mother on account of the resting-place of her earthly tabernacle being there. It is possible also that she is called Mother because the tribes of Judah and Benjamin were joined together, and Herod slew not only all the children that were in Bethlehem, but also in all the coasts thereof.<br />
