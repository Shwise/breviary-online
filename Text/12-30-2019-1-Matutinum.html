<b>Hymn</b> <em>{from the Common or Feast}</em>
<br />
<i class="a">J</i>esus, the Ransomer of man, <br />
Who, ere created light began, <br />
Didst from the sovereign Father spring,<br />
His power and glory equalling.<br />
 <br />
The Father’s Light and Splendor Thou,<br />
Their endless hope to Thee that bow;<br />
Accept the prayers and praise to-day<br />
That through the world Thy servants pay.<br />
 <br />
Salvation’s Author, call to mind<br />
How, taking form of humankind,<br />
Born of a Virgin undefiled,<br />
Thou in man’s flesh becam’st a Child.<br />
 <br />
Thus testifies the present day, <br />
Through every year in long array, <br />
That Thou, salvation’s source alone,<br />
Proceedest from the Father’s throne.<br />
 <br />
The heavens above, the rolling main<br />
And all that earth’s wide realms contain,<br />
With joyous voice now loudly sing<br />
The glory of their new-born King.<br />
 <br />
And we who, by Thy precious Blood<br />
From sin redeemed, are marked for God,<br />
On this the day that saw Thy birth,<br />
Sing the new song of ransomed earth.<br />
 <br />
O Lord, the Virgin-born, to Thee<br />
Eternal praise and glory be, <br />
Whom with the Father we adore <br />
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />

<span class="ri">Nocturn I</span><br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath said unto Me: * Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten thee.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 2</span><em> [1]</em><br />
<span class="w">2:1</span>  Why have the Gentiles raged, * and the people devised vain things?<br />
<span class="w">2:2</span>  The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, * against the Lord and against his Christ.<br />
<span class="w">2:3</span>  Let us break their bonds asunder: * and let us cast away their yoke from us.<br />
<span class="w">2:4</span>  He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: * and the Lord shall deride them.<br />
<span class="w">2:5</span>  Then shall he speak to them in his anger, * and trouble them in his rage.<br />
<span class="w">2:6</span>  But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain, * preaching his commandment.<br />
<span class="w">2:7</span>  The Lord hath said to me: * Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.<br />
<span class="w">2:8</span>  Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, * and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.<br />
<span class="w">2:9</span>  Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, * and shalt break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.<br />
<span class="w">2:10</span>  And now, O ye kings, understand: * receive instruction, you that judge the earth.<br />
<span class="w">2:11</span>  Serve ye the Lord with fear: * and rejoice unto him with trembling.<br />
<span class="w">2:12</span>  Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, * and you perish from the just way.<br />
<span class="w">2:13</span>  When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, * blessed are all they that trust in him.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />
<span class="ri">R.</span> As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br />
 <br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord hath said unto Me: Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten thee.<br />
<span class="ri">Ant.</span> The Lord is as a bridegroom * coming out of his chamber.<br />
<span class="ri">Psalm 18</span><em> [2]</em><br />
<span class="w">18:2</span>  The heavens shew forth the glory of God, * and the firmament declareth the work of his hands.<br />
<span class="w">18:3</span>  Day to day uttereth speech, * and night to night sheweth knowledge.<br />
<span class="w">18:4</span>  There are no speeches nor languages, * where their voices are not heard.<br />
<span class="w">18:5</span>  Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: * and their words unto the ends of the world.<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: * and he, as a bridegroom coming out of his bride chamber,<br />
<span class="w">18:6</span>  Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: * his going out is from the end of heaven,<br />
<span class="w">18:7</span>  And his circuit even to the end thereof: * and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.<br />
<span class="w">18:8</span>  The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: * the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.<br />
<span class="w">18:9</span>  The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: * the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.<br />
<span class="w">18:10</span>  The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: * the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.<br />
<span class="w">18:11</span>  More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: * and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br />
<span class="w">18:12</span>  For thy servant keepeth them, * and in keeping them there is a great reward.<br />
<span class="w">18:13</span>  Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: * and from those of others spare thy servant.<br />
<span class="w">18:14</span>  If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: * and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: * and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight.<br />
<span class="w">18:15</span>  O Lord, my helper, * and my redeemer.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="ri">Psalm 44</span><em> [3]</em><br />
<span class="w">44:2</span>  My heart hath uttered a good word; * I speak my works to the King.<br />
<span class="w">44:2</span>  My tongue is the pen of a scrivener * that writeth swiftly.<br />

<span class="w">44:4</span>  Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, * O thou most mighty.<br />
<span class="w">44:5</span>  With thy comeliness and thy beauty * set out, proceed prosperously, and reign.<br />
<span class="w">44:5</span>  Because of truth and meekness and justice: * and thy right hand shall conduct thee wonderfully.<br />
<span class="w">44:6</span>  Thy arrows are sharp: under thee shall people fall, * into the hearts of the king’s enemies.<br />
<span class="w">44:7</span>  Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: * the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness.<br />
<span class="w">44:8</span>  Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: * therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br />
<span class="w">44:9</span>  Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: * out of which the daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory.<br />
<span class="w">44:10</span>  The queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; * surrounded with variety.<br />
<span class="w">44:11</span>  Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thy ear: * and forget thy people and thy father’s house.<br />
<span class="w">44:12</span>  And the king shall greatly desire thy beauty; * for he is the Lord thy God, and him they shall adore.<br />
<span class="w">44:13</span>  And the daughters of Tyre with gifts, * yea, all the rich among the people, shall entreat thy countenance.<br />
<span class="w">44:14</span>  All the glory of the king’s daughter is within, * in golden borders, clothed round about with varieties.<br />
<span class="w">44:15</span>  After her shall virgins be brought to the king: * her neighbours shall be brought to thee.<br />
<span class="w">44:16</span>  They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing: * they shall be brought into the temple of the king.<br />
<span class="w">44:17</span>  Instead of thy fathers, sons are born to thee: * thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.<br />
<span class="w">44:18</span>  They shall remember thy name * throughout all generations.<br />
<span class="w">44:18</span>  Therefore shall people praise thee for ever; yea, * for ever and ever.<br />
<span class="ri">V.</span> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost. <br />

<span class="w">3</span> And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?<br />
<span class="w">4</span> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?<br />
