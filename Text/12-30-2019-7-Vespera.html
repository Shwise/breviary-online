<i class="a">G</i>od, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all, in these days hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.<br />

<span class="ri">Hymn</span><br />
<i class="a">J</i>esus, the Ransomer of man, <br />
Who, ere created light began, <br />
Didst from the sovereign Father spring,<br />
His power and glory equalling.<br />
 <br />
The Fatherâ€™s Light and Splendor Thou,<br />
Their endless hope to Thee that bow;<br />
Accept the prayers and praise to-day<br />
That through the world Thy servants pay.<br />
 <br />
Salvationâ€™s Author, call to mind<br />
How, taking form of humankind,<br />
Born of a Virgin undefiled,<br />
Thou in manâ€™s flesh becamâ€™st a Child.<br />
 <br />
Thus testifies the present day, <br />
Through every year in long array, <br />
That Thou, salvationâ€™s source alone,<br />
Proceedest from the Fatherâ€™s throne.<br />
 <br />
The heavens above, the rolling main<br />
And all that earthâ€™s wide realms contain,<br />
With joyous voice now loudly sing<br />
The glory of their new-born King.<br />
 <br />
And we who, by Thy precious Blood<br />
From sin redeemed, are marked for God,<br />
On this the day that saw Thy birth,<br />
Sing the new song of ransomed earth.<br />
 <br />
O Lord, the Virgin-born, to Thee<br />
Eternal praise and glory be, <br />
Whom with the Father we adore <br />
And Holy Ghost forevermore.<br />
Amen.<br />
